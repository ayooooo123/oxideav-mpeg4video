//! §6.2.7 `block(i)` macroblock-level texture assembly for I- and
//! inter-coded macroblocks.
//!
//! Rounds 9..14 built every stage of the §7.4.x intra texture pipeline
//! as standalone functions: §7.4.1.1 intra-DC decode, §7.4.1.2 AC EVENT
//! decode, §7.4.2 inverse scan, §7.4.3 spatial DC/AC predictor, §7.4.4
//! inverse quantisation, and §7.4.5 + Annex A inverse DCT. This module
//! is the per-macroblock driver that wires those stages together: for an
//! intra macroblock it walks the §6.1.3.9 / Figure 6-8 block ordering
//! (4 luminance + 2 chrominance blocks in 4:2:0), runs each block's
//! `block(i)` syntax of §6.2.7 through the §7.4.x chain, and assembles
//! the reconstructed 16×16 luminance + 8×8 Cb / 8×8 Cr macroblock.
//!
//! Round 21 (this round) adds the **inter** half of the §6.2.7 driver:
//! [`decode_inter_block`] runs the `if (pattern_code[i]) while (!last)
//! DCT coefficient` branch of the §6.2.7 syntax table — the entire
//! intra-DC prologue is gated out for inter `derived_mb_type` values, so
//! an inter block carries no DC coefficient at all (§6.2.7 line "if
//! (!data_partitioned && (derived_mb_type == 3 || derived_mb_type == 4))
//! { intra-DC … }"), no spatial predictor add (§7.4.3 is intra-only),
//! and always uses [`crate::scan::ScanType::Zigzag`] (§7.4.2 "Non-intra
//! blocks → zigzag"). The IDCT output `f[y][x]` is the §7.3 step-2
//! *residual* — it is NOT clipped to `[0, 2^bpp − 1]` because the §7.3
//! step-3 display clip happens after `d[y][x] = p[y][x] + f[y][x]`. The
//! per-block residual stays in `[−2^bpp, 2^bpp − 1]` from §7.4.5.
//! [`decode_inter_macroblock`] assembles a [`InterMacroblock`] of 16×16
//! luma + 8×8 Cb / 8×8 Cr signed-residual planes for any
//! `derived_mb_type ∈ {Inter, InterQ, Inter4V}` macroblock. The
//! caller's motion-compensation stage adds the prediction and applies
//! the §7.3 step-3 display clip.
//!
//! ## §6.2.7 `block(i)` syntax (intra branch)
//!
//! For an intra macroblock (`derived_mb_type == 3 || == 4`) with
//! `data_partitioned == 0` and `short_video_header == 0`, each block's
//! texture is:
//!
//! ```text
//! block(i) {
//!     last = 0
//!     if (use_intra_dc_vlc == 1) {
//!         if (i < 4) dct_dc_size_luminance + dct_dc_differential + marker
//!         else       dct_dc_size_chrominance + dct_dc_differential + marker
//!     }
//!     if (pattern_code[i])
//!         while (!last) DCT coefficient
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The differential intra-DC ([`crate::texture::decode_intra_dc`]) is
//! always present for blocks of an intra macroblock when
//! `use_intra_dc_vlc == 1`; the §7.4.1.2 AC EVENT loop
//! ([`crate::texture::decode_ac_events`]) runs only when
//! `pattern_code[i] == 1`.
//!
//! ## `pattern_code[i]` (§6.3.7 / §6.2.7)
//!
//! `pattern_code[i]` is the per-block "this block has at least one
//! coded AC coefficient" flag. For the 4:2:0 macroblock it is assembled
//! from the macroblock header's `cbpy` (the four luminance blocks,
//! Table B.8) and `cbpc` (the two chrominance blocks, carried in
//! `mcbpc`, Tables B.6 / B.7), per the §6.3.7 semantics — `cbpy`
//! "represents a pattern of non-transparent luminance blocks with at
//! least one non intra DC transform coefficient", and `cbpc` the
//! chrominance equivalent. The bit-to-block mapping follows
//! Figure 6-8's block order and the existing macroblock-header field
//! conventions:
//!
//! * `cbpy` bit 3 → block 0 (luma top-left), bit 2 → block 1 (top-
//!   right), bit 1 → block 2 (bottom-left), bit 0 → block 3 (bottom-
//!   right).
//! * `cbpc` bit 1 → block 4 (Cb), bit 0 → block 5 (Cr).
//!
//! This is identical to the §6.2.7 pattern-derivation
//! `if (cbp & (1 << (5 - i))) pattern_code[i] = 1` with
//! `cbp = (cbpy << 2) | cbpc` (block 0 at bit 5 down to block 5 at
//! bit 0).
//!
//! ## The §7.4.x chain per block
//!
//! 1. **Read coefficients.** [`crate::texture::decode_intra_dc`] for the
//!    differential DC, then [`crate::texture::decode_ac_events`] for the
//!    AC EVENTs when `pattern_code[i]`.
//! 2. **Expand to `QFS[64]`** ([`crate::scan::events_to_qfs`]) with the
//!    differential DC at scan position 0, then convert to the 2-D
//!    `PQF[v][u]` block via the §7.4.2 inverse scan
//!    ([`crate::scan::inverse_scan`]) under the §7.4.2-selected scan
//!    pattern ([`crate::scan::select_scan_type`]).
//! 3. **Spatial predictor** (§7.4.3): add the §7.4.3.2 DC predictor and
//!    the §7.4.3.3 AC predictors (gated by `ac_pred_flag`) to obtain the
//!    quantised `QF[v][u]`, then §7.4.3.4-saturate to `[-2048, 2047]`.
//! 4. **Inverse quantisation** (§7.4.4): method 1 (`quant_type == 1`,
//!    with the `W[0]` intra matrix) or method 2 (`quant_type == 0`),
//!    yielding the reconstructed `F[v][u]`.
//! 5. **Inverse DCT** (§7.4.5 + Annex A): [`crate::idct::idct_8x8`]
//!    produces the spatial samples `f[y][x]`, saturated to
//!    `[-2^bpp, 2^bpp - 1]`.
//! 6. **Final clip** (§6.3.2 / the §7.6 reconstruction): for an intra
//!    block there is no prediction to add, so the reconstructed sample
//!    is the IDCT output clipped to the display range
//!    `[0, 2^bpp - 1]`.
//!
//! ## Predictor neighbours this round
//!
//! Gathering the §7.4.3 predictor candidates from a concrete block grid
//! (the Figure 7-5 walk over neighbouring macroblocks) is a separate
//! task. This module accepts the predictor neighbourhood as an explicit
//! [`BlockPredictors`] argument — its
//! [`outside`][`BlockPredictors::outside`] constructor is the
//! §7.4.3.1 / §7.4.3.3 "neighbour outside the VOP / video packet" case
//! (default DC of `2^(bpp+2)`, all AC prediction coefficients zero),
//! which is exactly the predictor state for the first intra macroblock
//! of a VOP. A caller that has gathered neighbours threads them in per
//! block.
//!
//! ## Out of scope (this round)
//!
//! * Motion compensation and inter / B-VOP reconstruction.
//! * The Figure 7-5 predictor-candidate gathering over a block grid.
//! * The `short_video_header == 1` fixed-8-bit DC path and the
//!   `data_partitioned == 1` reordering.
//! * Non-rectangular shape (`transparent_block(i)`), 4:2:2 / 4:4:4
//!   chroma formats, and the SA-DCT path.
//!
//! ## Spec references
//!
//! All numbers come from ISO/IEC 14496-2:2004 (3rd edition), read by the
//! agent from
//! `docs/video/mpeg4-visual/ISO_IEC_14496-2-2004-3rd-edition.txt`:
//!
//! * §6.1.3.9 / Figure 6-8 — 4:2:0 macroblock block ordering
//!   (0,1 / 2,3 luminance; 4 Cb; 5 Cr).
//! * §6.2.6 macroblock() — the `for (i = 0; i < block_count; i++)
//!   block(i)` loop (block_count = 6 for 4:2:0).
//! * §6.2.7 block(i) — the intra-DC branch and the
//!   `if (pattern_code[i]) while (!last) DCT coefficient` loop.
//! * §6.3.7 — `cbpy` / `cbpc` semantics; `pattern_code[i]` is set to 1
//!   when the block has one or more coded AC coefficients.
//! * §6.3.3 — the default intra / non-intra quantisation matrices used
//!   when no matrix was loaded (`quant_type == 1`).
