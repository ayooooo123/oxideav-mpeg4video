//! Decode-behaviour selection where the ISO/IEC 14496-2 text and the
//! deployed decoder ecosystem disagree.
//!
//! This crate's default behaviour is always the **literal
//! specification text**. For the clauses below, comparison against
//! reference decodes of conformant streams shows the deployed ecosystem
//! (FFmpeg) behaves differently, so real-world streams produced and
//! consumed by that ecosystem reconstruct slightly differently from the
//! printed clauses. [`DecodeOptions`] carries the opt-in
//! **ecosystem-compat** switch that reproduces the observed behaviour
//! bit-for-bit; the registry decoder
//! ([`crate::decoder::make_decoder`]) turns it on by default. It covers
//! exactly these divergences:
//!
//! 1. **§7.7.2.2 interlaced direct mode.** The spec derives the four
//!    field motion vectors "from the forward field motion vectors of
//!    the co-located macroblock of the future reference VOP" — the
//!    `MV[i]` term of the pseudo code. Observed reference decodes
//!    evaluate the same (erratum-corrected) derivation with the
//!    co-located field motion vectors read as **zero**, so the derived
//!    vectors reduce to `mvf[i] = mvb[i] = MVD[0]` on the field grid,
//!    while the forward reference fields still follow the co-located
//!    macroblock's field selections (root-caused by exhaustive
//!    per-macroblock-field pixel search — see `tests/conformance.rs`).
//!
//!    Constructed-probe arbitration with provably **non-zero**
//!    co-located field MVs over textured anchors
//!    (`tests/direct_mode_probes.rs`) confirmed this model
//!    unconditionally for a transmitted non-zero `MVD[0]` and for the
//!    zero-bit `modb == "1"` form. The same probes established a
//!    boundary the compat mode deliberately does **not** reproduce
//!    yet: for a direct macroblock whose `MVD[0]` is *transmitted but
//!    exactly (0, 0)*, the observed ecosystem runs **progressive**
//!    direct mode over the co-located frame vector
//!    `Div2Round(MVf1 + MVf2)` instead. No conformance-corpus stream
//!    contains such a macroblock; whether the compat mode should
//!    adopt that branch awaits a project ruling (the probe pins
//!    record both modes' measured envelopes so any change is
//!    deliberate).
//!
//! 2. **§7.4.4.5 mismatch control.** The spec applies the method-1
//!    (`quant_type == 1`) sum-parity toggle of `F[7][7]` to every
//!    block. Observed reference decodes apply it to **non-intra blocks
//!    only** (verified per block class: suppressing the intra toggle
//!    collapses a method-1 stream's differences to isolated IDCT
//!    near-ties).
//!
//! 3. **§7.8.7.3 GMC averaged motion vector.** The spec quantises the
//!    averaged pel-wise warping vector of a GMC macroblock to the
//!    half- (or quarter-) sample grid with the `//` rounding and uses
//!    it as the §7.6.5 predictor candidate and the §7.6.9 frame-direct
//!    co-located vector. Observed reference decodes derive each
//!    **non-positive** component one MV-grid unit lower (strictly
//!    positive components exact; per-component independent). Measured
//!    on crafted GMC-neighbour + zero-MVD-local probes at half-sample
//!    (du −2→−3, −3→−4, −4→−5, −10→−11, 0→−1) and quarter-sample
//!    (−6→−7, −8→−9, −18→−19, −20→−21); pinned bit-exact by the
//!    `dec_sgmc_*` fixture pairs (`tests/compat_gmc_amv.rs`).
//!
//! 4. **8×8 block placement** (FFmpeg mpegvideo_motion.c hpel_motion,
//!    apply_8x8, chroma_4mv_motion; mpeg4video.c ff_mpeg4_set_direct_mv).
//!    The integer source position of an 8×8 prediction block (a
//!    four-vector macroblock's luminance blocks and its chrominance
//!    block, and a direct-mode macroblock whose co-located macroblock
//!    had four vectors or whose VOL is quarter-sample) is clipped to
//!    `[-16, width]` × `[-16, height]` of the visible area (`[-8, width /
//!    2]` × `[-8, height / 2]` for chrominance), an axis dropping its
//!    fraction where the clip leaves the block at the visible edge.
//!    Where the picture does not fill its last macroblock row or column
//!    the samples there are decoded ones, so the clip moves such a block.
//!
//! 5. **Packets** (h263dec.c ff_h263_decode_frame, mpeg4videodec.c
//!    ff_mpeg4_parse_picture_header, mpeg4_decode_picture_header,
//!    ff_mpeg4_frame_end). A not-coded VOP gives no picture (its anchor
//!    time still moves on), and neither does a B-VOP without a past
//!    anchor or with its times out of order. The registry decoder
//!    decodes the first VOP of each packet only; in a DivX packed
//!    bitstream (user data `DivX…p`) a B-VOP after it is kept and
//!    decoded in place of the next packet's placeholder, and a
//!    low-delay stream that ends with a not-coded VOP shows its last
//!    picture once more.
//!
//! Everything else decodes identically in both modes. The switch is
//! wired through every public decode surface: the
//! [`crate::vop_decode`] macroblock walks take a [`DecodeOptions`]
//! argument, [`crate::decoder::Mpeg4VideoDecoder::with_options`]
//! configures the elementary-stream decoder, and the registry /
//! [`crate::decoder::make_decoder`] path reads the `ecosystem-compat`
//! key from [`CodecParameters::options`](oxideav_core::CodecParameters)
//! (see [`crate::decoder::Mpeg4DecoderOptions`]).
