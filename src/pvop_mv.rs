//! §7.6 progressive P-VOP macroblock motion-vector decode driver.
//!
//! The lower-level primitives the spec splits §7.6 into are already
//! implemented as composable, independently-tested pieces:
//!
//! * [`crate::motion::decode_motion_vector_delta`] — the §6.2.6.2
//!   `motion_vector(mode)` body (Table B.12 `mv_data` VLC + the
//!   `r_size`-bit residual) reconstructed to a [`MotionVectorDelta`]
//!   via the §7.6.3 recurrence.
//! * [`crate::mv_predictor_grid::MvGrid::predictor_candidates`] — the
//!   Figure 7-34 candidate gather (`MV1` / `MV2` / `MV3` positions for
//!   each of the four 8×8 luminance blocks) into a
//!   `[Option<MotionVector>; 3]`.
//! * [`crate::motion::predict_motion_vector`] — the §7.6.5 four
//!   validity rules + the component-wise `Median` predictor.
//! * [`crate::motion::reconstruct_motion_vector`] — the predictor add
//!   plus the §7.6.3 / Table 7-9 modulo wrap into `[low:high]`.
//!
//! What this module adds is the **driver** that wires those four stages
//! together in raster order so that each macroblock's just-decoded
//! motion vectors become valid spatial neighbours for the macroblocks
//! decoded after it. That ordering is the whole point of the §7.6.5
//! median predictor: `MV1` (left), `MV2` (above) and `MV3` (above-right)
//! all refer to macroblocks earlier in the raster scan, and the
//! predictor is undefined unless those neighbours were recorded as they
//! were decoded.
//!
//! ## Per-macroblock dispatch (§6.2.6 / Table B.1 `derived_mb_type`)
//!
//! For a progressive P-VOP (`short_video_header == 0`, `interlaced ==
//! 0`) the §6.2.6 macroblock layer decodes, in order:
//!
//! 1. **`not_coded == 1`** — the skipped macroblock. §7.6.2 treats it
//!    as inter-coded with a **zero motion vector**: no `motion_vector()`
//!    body is present, and the predictor for the next macroblock sees
//!    this one as a valid `(0, 0)` neighbour. Recorded as
//!    [`MbMv::OneMv`]`((0, 0))`.
//! 2. **Intra / intra+q** (`derived_mb_type ∈ {3, 4}`) — no motion
//!    vector. The §7.6.5 validity rules treat an intra macroblock the
//!    same as a transparent one: it is **not a valid candidate**.
//!    Recorded as [`MbMv::Absent`] so every sub-block query against it
//!    returns [`None`].
//! 3. **Inter / inter+q** (`derived_mb_type ∈ {0, 1}`) — the 1-MV path.
//!    A single `motion_vector("forward")` body is decoded; its
//!    predictor is the §7.6.5 median for **block 0** (the top-left case,
//!    per the Figure 7-34 "1-MV mode uses the top-left case" rule). The
//!    reconstructed vector is recorded as [`MbMv::OneMv`].
//! 4. **inter4v** (`derived_mb_type == 2`) — the 4-MV path. Four
//!    `motion_vector("forward")` bodies are decoded, one per 8×8
//!    luminance block in Figure 6-8 order. **Each** block's predictor is
//!    the §7.6.5 median gathered for **that** block index, and crucially
//!    the predictor for blocks 1..3 sees the just-decoded vectors of the
//!    earlier blocks **of the same macroblock** (Figure 7-34 places
//!    several of an inter4v block's candidates inside the current MB).
//!    To make those in-MB candidates visible, the grid record is
//!    updated incrementally as each block vector is reconstructed.
//!    Recorded as [`MbMv::FourMv`].
//!
//! ## Predictor reset at row / packet boundaries
//!
//! The §7.6.5 candidate gather already returns [`None`] for any
//! neighbour outside the grid (row `-1`, column `-1`, or past the right
//! edge), so the left/above/above-right macroblocks of the first row and
//! first column are correctly invalid. A video-packet boundary inside a
//! row is signalled to the driver by [`MvDriver::reset_packet`], which
//! marks every macroblock decoded so far in the *current* row as not a
//! valid neighbour for macroblocks after the boundary (the §7.6.5
//! "outside the current video packet → treated as transparent" rule).
//! The caller invokes it immediately after consuming a `resync_marker` +
//! `video_packet_header`.
//!
//! ## Scope
//!
//! This is the **progressive** P-VOP path: `quarter_sample` only changes
//! the *units* of the decoded vector (the Table B.12 / §7.6.3 path is
//! identical — quarter-pel vs half-pel is a downstream interpolation
//! concern), so the driver is unit-agnostic. The interlaced field-MV
//! predictor (§7.7.2.1) and the S(GMC) `mcsel` averaged-vector
//! substitution (§7.8.7.3) have their own gather entry points
//! ([`MvGrid::field_predictor_candidates`] /
//! [`crate::motion::averaged_motion_vector`]) and are driven elsewhere.
