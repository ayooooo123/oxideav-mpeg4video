Pure-Rust clean-room decoder **and encoder** for MPEG-4 Part 2 Video
(ISO/IEC 14496-2 / MPEG-4 Visual / ASP) for the
[oxideav](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-workspace) framework. This
is the standard MPEG-4 Part 2 bitstream (XVID / DIVX / DX50 / FMP4 /
MP4V) — *not* the pre-standard Microsoft MPEG-4 family, which lives in
[`oxideav-msmpeg4`](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-msmpeg4).

## Status

Clean-room rebuild: **the decoder is now a working end-to-end codec**.
`decoder::Mpeg4VideoDecoder` consumes a raw MPEG-4 Visual elementary
stream (start-code-delimited §6.2.1 units) and emits display-order
frames: start-code scan → §6.2 configuration headers → §6.2.4 GOV /
§6.2.5 VOP headers → the `vop_decode` bitstream macroblock walks (I /
P / B / S(GMC), with §6.2.5.2 video-packet resync handling) → the
§7.6.1 reference-frame chain → §6.1.3.8 display reorder. The §6.3.5
time model derives each B-VOP's §7.6.7 `TRB`/`TRD` from the composed
VOP times. **Real-stream conformance is now bit-exact**: against a
black-box reference decode using the ideal (floating-point) Annex A.1
IDCT, twelve reference-encoder-produced streams — intra-only, I+P,
I/P/B, qpel-IP, qpel-IPB, qpel+4MV-IPB, AC-prediction IPB,
progressive alternate-scan IPB, data-partitioned IPB, 176×144 IPB
with video packets, an interlaced I+P, and an interlaced qpel-IP
(field motion + quarter-sample) — decode **bit-for-bit
identically**; four more match up to a documented budget of ±1
"near-tie" samples (the oracle's single-precision IDCT crossing a
rounding boundary the ideal value sits within ~1e-5 of), and the
remaining three carry bounded, root-caused oracle deviations
(`tests/conformance.rs`, fixture provenance + SHA-256 in
`tests/fixtures/NOTES.md`). Two of those deviations are
**spec-vs-ecosystem divergences** now covered by the opt-in
[ecosystem-compat mode](#compatibility-modes): with it enabled the
method-1 (`mpeg_quant`) stream and the interlaced-I/P/B stream
collapse to near-tie-only differences, and 29 of the corpus' 30
§7.7.2.2 interlaced-direct macroblocks decode bit-exact. The crate
**registers
into the runtime codec registry** (`mpeg4video`, FourCCs XVID / DIVX /
DX50 / FMP4 / MP4V / M4S2 + MP4 OTI `0x20`) via a packet decoder that
supports extradata priming, seeks (`reset`), and the pixel-count DoS
cap; `decoder::make_decoder` is the direct factory endpoint. The
bitstream walks cover the rectangular path in **half- and
quarter-sample** modes (§7.6.2.1 / §7.6.2.2 with the Figure 7-30
per-block boundary mirroring), with **§7.6.6 overlapped motion
compensation** (`obmc_disable == 0`), **per-sub-block §7.6.9.5.2
direct-mode co-located MVs**, **presentation timestamps** (container
pts through the §6.1.3.8 reorder + §6.3.5 tick times), and
**interlaced tools**: §7.7.1 field DCT + alternate vertical scan,
§7.7.2.1 field-predicted P macroblocks (CASE 1/2/3 predictors, field
MC, Div2Round field chroma), and §7.7.2.2 interlaced B-VOPs (field
forward / backward / bidirectional through the Table 7-15 **unified
four-PMV bank** shared by frame- and field-predicted macroblocks +
interlaced direct mode). The §7.7.2.2 printed pseudo code carries
several defects; this decoder implements the corrected readings
(erratum E1 backward-call field ordering, E2 `MVD[0]` gate, same-slot
`PMV[3].x` field-backward reconstruction, §7.6.5 intra neighbours as
valid zero MV candidates, and the f_code==1 direct-delta rule), each
**black-box-arbitrated** against a conformant interlaced direct-mode
B-frame stream (docs fixture, refs #176), plus the field-grid
vertical arithmetic the §7.7.2 evenness invariant requires. The
long-standing interlaced-direct deviation is now **root-caused**: an
exhaustive per-macroblock-field pixel search (12 uniquely-determined
macroblock-fields, all consistent) proves the reference decoder
evaluates the corrected §7.7.2.2 pseudo code with the co-located
field motion vectors substituted by zero (its derived vectors reduce
to `mvf[i] = mvb[i] = MVD[0]` on the field grid, forward reference
fields still following the co-located selections); §7.7.2.2 derives
"from the forward field motion vectors of the co-located future
reference VOP", so this decoder keeps the spec's `MV[i]` term **by
default** and the affected macroblocks carry a bounded, documented
envelope; the [ecosystem-compat mode](#compatibility-modes) opts into
the observed zero-co-located derivation instead.
**§6.2.5.3 data-partitioned I-/P-VOPs
decode end-to-end** (`decode_i_vop_macroblocks_dp` /
`decode_p_vop_macroblocks_dp`: per-packet dc_marker / motion_marker
partition structure, §E.1.2 prediction resets, header-partition intra
DC feeding the texture partition, Table B.23 RVLC texture when
`reversible_vlc == 1`), with B-VOPs on the combined syntax per the
§6.2.5.3 NOTE. Twenty-four black-box conformance fixtures (intra /
IP / IPB / qpel {IP, IPB, +4MV} / AC-prediction / alternate-scan /
data-partitioned IPB / QCIF-resync IPB / interlaced × {intra,
alt-scan, IP, IP-motion, IPB, qpel-IP, qpel-IPB, direct-B 176×144} /
mpeg-quant × {plain, qpel+4MV, interlaced-B, interlaced-qpel-B,
data-partitioned}) are asserted
bit-exact, near-exact, or envelope-bounded as described above — each
also pinned under the compat mode. The **interlaced quarter-sample
field interpolation** (`ildct + ilme + qpel`) is bit-exact: its
geometry — two 8×8 §7.6.2.2 blocks per 16-wide luma field block with
per-sub-block Figure 7-30 mirroring, and floor-halving of the chroma
field MV's vertical quarter → half step — was black-box-arbitrated
over seven constructed single-macroblock field-prediction probe
streams, now committed as regression pins
(`tests/field_qpel_probes.rs`).

**Short header** (`short_video_header == 1`, §6.2.5.2 — the
H.263-compatible syntax): both directions. The stream decoder
recognises a VOL-less stream opening with `short_video_start_marker`
and decodes its pictures (`short_header`: Table 6-28 fixed tools,
Table 6-29 source formats sub-QCIF … 16CIF, optional byte-aligned GOB
headers with the §7.6.5 GOB predictor rule and `quant_scale` restart,
8-bit `intra_dc_coefficient` with `dc_scaler = 8`, no DC/AC
prediction, Table B.17 + Type-4 escapes, `f_code == 1` vectors, the
30000/1001 Hz `temporal_reference` clock); a reference-encoder-produced
H.263 stream decodes **bit-exact**. The encoder's `short-header` option
emits I/P pictures of the same syntax (`short_header_encode`: DC
clamped into the FLC domain, levels into the Type-4 range, vectors
restricted to the picture per §7.6.4, GOB headers on request) — the
reference decoder reproduces our stream **bit-exact**.

**The encoder** covers rectangular **progressive and interlaced I-,
P- and B-VOPs** end-to-end: §6.2 configuration-header emission
(VOS/VO/VOL, SP/L3 or ASP/L3 per the tool set; verid-2 VOL for
quarter-sample; `interlaced` with per-VOP `top_field_first` /
`alternate_vertical_scan_flag`;
`vol_control_parameters` with `low_delay` and the Annex D
`vbv_parameters` when applicable; `resync_marker_disable` /
`data_partitioned` / `reversible_vlc` per the resilience tools), Annex
A.1 forward DCT (compile-time correctly-rounded cosine kernels shared
with the IDCT, so both directions are byte-deterministic on every
platform), method-1 and method-2 forward quantisation, §7.4.3 DC/AC
prediction *emission* (same `IntraBlockGrid` neighbour resolution as
the decoder, `ac_pred_flag` decided per macroblock by measured cost
under the active syntax layout), inverse-table VLC emission (Tables
B.6–B.17 + all three §7.4.1.3 escape modes, and the Table B.23
reversible VLC + Type-5 escape, each exhaustively round-tripped
against the decode tables), §7.6 motion estimation over the **Table
7-9 range of any `fcode` 1..=7** (dense ±8-pel search, and beyond it
a coarse 4-pel lattice over the `±16·2^(fcode−1)`-pel window with
dense refinement; half-sample — and in `qpel` mode §7.6.2.2
quarter-sample — refinement through the decoder's own interpolators,
clamped to `[low, high]`; differentials in the `r_size`-bit residual
form after the §7.6.3 wrap), cost-decided §6.3.7 **inter4v (4MV)**
macroblocks (per-block §7.6.5 medians with the in-MB Figure 7-34
candidates threaded exactly as the decoder's `MvDriver` does), the
§7.6.5 median predictor over decoder-mirrored `MvGrid` state,
`not_coded` skips, **per-macroblock quantiser modulation**
(`mb_quant`: activity-classed ±2 offsets around the VOP quantiser
planned against the §6.3.7 running value — Table 6-32 `dquant` via the
`intra+q` / `inter+q` types on I/P-VOPs, Table 6-33 `dbquant` on
non-direct coded B macroblocks; inter4v and skips keep the running
value), **B-VOP encoding** (per-MB §7.6.9 mode decision across direct /
forward / backward / interpolated — every candidate scored on the
prediction the decoder's own machinery generates; §6.2.6 emission
incl. the `modb "1"` compact form, the `co_located_not_coded` zero-bit
form, and the §7.6.8 running per-direction predictors; a `bf`-deep
reorder queue with Annex D item-7 decode-time stamps), a `gop-size`
keyframe cadence, **Annex D rate control** (the D.2 VBV rate-buffer
model simulated on the encoder side with an item-9 admission gate that
re-encodes an oversized VOP at a coarser quantiser; the default
**budget-driven** mode — `rate_control::BudgetPlanner` — allots a bit
budget per GOP, splits it over the GOP's remaining I/P/B-VOPs by a
per-class `bits × qp` complexity model (trailing B-VOPs charged to the
GOP they belong to, surplus / deficit carried between GOPs at one
second's worth per second, first VOP of each class calibrated by a
re-encode when it misses its target by more than a quarter), clamps
each VOP's target against the VBV occupancy and hands it to the
macroblock loop as an `mb_quant::MbBudget` — the `dquant` / `dbquant`
steps then regulate the spend inside the VOP against an
activity-weighted expected-spend curve (`mb_quant::MbRegulator`, band
`rc-band` around `vop_quant`); an optional **two-pass** plan
(`pass=1` writes `rate_control::FirstPassStats` to `stats-file`,
`pass=2` plans every VOP's share from the measured complexities);
`rc-mode=vop` keeps the earlier per-VOP reactive controller), and the
**GMC emission** (`svop_encode`: S(GMC)-VOP anchors with one, two or
three §7.8.4 warping points at half-pel accuracy — one point carries
the dominant per-MB translation, clamped into the Table 7-9 range so
the §7.8.7.3 averaged-MV clip never fires; two / three points carry a
§7.8.5 similarity / affine model fitted to the motion field
(mode-seeded robust least squares, then coordinate-descent refinement
of the `du`/`dv` integers on the decoder's own warp); per-MB `mcsel`
decides GMC vs local prediction with a quantiser-scaled preference,
`not_coded` GMC copies included, and the per-MB averaged MV threads
the predictor grid exactly as the decoder's `MvDriver` does), the
**Table 6-25 `intra_dc_vlc_thr`** (explicit 0..=7 — intra DC
differentials ride the AC VLC at scan position 0 once the
macroblock's running quantiser reaches the threshold, in the combined
and the data-partitioned layouts — or elected per I-VOP over the
whole table by measured cost: one probe encode costs every
macroblock under both DC-differential VLCs, the eight thresholds are
scored against the per-macroblock running quantisers, and the winner
is carried to the following P/S-VOPs), the **interlaced tools** (`field_encode` /
`bvop_interlaced_encode`: per-macroblock §7.7.1 `dct_type` elected
from the same-field vs frame-line vertical correlation of the source
or residual, with the luminance permuted per Figure 6-12 before the
transform; §7.7.2.1 **field-predicted P macroblocks** — one vector per
output field against the better reference-field parity, estimated
through the decoder's own field `mc` / §7.6.2.2 field cascade, coded
against the shared CASE 1/2/3 predictor on the field grid and confined
to the Table 7-9 range; §7.7.2.2 **interlaced B modes** — field
forward / backward / bidirectional through the Table 7-14 four-PMV
bank shared with the frame modes, and **interlaced direct** over a
field-predicted co-located anchor with its Table 7-16 δ-corrected
field-period scaling and an `MVD[0]` search; **interlaced
S(GMC)-VOPs** — GMC macroblocks frame-predicted per §7.8.7.2 with
field DCT on their residuals, local macroblocks field-predicted
against the GMC neighbours' averaged-MV candidates, both ways;
§6.2.6.3 `interlaced_information()` emitted between `dquant` /
`dbquant` and
the motion bodies with the exact decoder gates; an `ecosystem-compat`
emission that never codes direct mode over a field-predicted
co-located macroblock, keeping the stream inside the subset the
deployed decoders read as the spec does), and the
**error-resilience tools** (`packet_encode`: §6.2.5 video packets cut
at the first macroblock boundary past a bit target — §5.2.5 stuffing,
the §6.3.3 `resync_marker` of the VOP type / fcode, Table 6-27
`macroblock_number`, `quant_scale`, alternating
`header_extension_code` bodies including the S(GMC)-VOP
`sprite_trajectory()` restatement — with every prediction state reset
as the decoder's walks reset it; §6.2.5.3 **data partitioning** of I- and
P-VOPs with the `dc_marker` / `motion_marker` partitions; the
**reversible-VLC** texture partition; B-VOPs stay combined-syntax
inside a partitioned VOL per the §6.2.5.3 NOTE). Every emitted VOP is
**decoded back through the crate's own decoder walk** — the closed
loop that makes encoder reference state a conformant decoder's by
construction. Validation: self-encoded streams decode through
`Mpeg4VideoDecoder` sample-exact against the closed-loop
reconstructions (I-only, I+P with real motion, I/B/P in every tool
combination, every `fcode` × sample mode, adversarial stress content
across qp 1..=31 and partial-edge grids with the full resilient tool
set, and a corrupted RVLC texture partition still decoding through the
§E.1.4.4 recovery); black-box cross-checks pin byte-determinism and
decode agreement — the reference decoder's decode of our method-2
intra, I+P, 4MV, qpel, qpel+4MV, I/P/B, fcode-2 I+P, fcode-3 +
qpel + 4MV + B, adaptive-quant I/P/B, video-packet I/P/B,
data-partitioned I+P, data-partitioned + RVLC + packets I/P/B,
GMC + qpel I/S/B, **three-point affine GMC** I/S, **interlaced I+P**
(field DCT + field prediction), **interlaced I/P/B** (field B modes,
compat emission), **interlaced GMC** I/S/B, **short-header** I/P and
**AC-VLC intra DC + S-VOP packet HEC** I/S/B streams is **bit-exact**
against our own (twenty-one encoder-produced pairs; the two-point
similarity-GMC pair is exact up to one intra near-tie sample); the
spec-literal interlaced I/P/B + qpel stream differs from the reference
decode *only* inside its §7.7.2.2 interlaced-direct macroblocks, and
our ecosystem-compat decode of that very stream reproduces the
reference bit-exactly (compat divergence 1 confirmed on
encoder-produced content); and the method-1 stream lands exactly on the documented
§7.4.4.5 compat contract (ecosystem mode bit-exact, literal-spec ±1 on
834 samples); rate-controlled streams satisfy an independent Annex D
re-simulation (no underflow, `d_i < B`). Rate accuracy (measured /
target over 50 frames of a 64×64 moving-texture scene, 25 fps,
`tests/encoder_rate.rs`):

| GOP | bf | 150 kb/s budget | 150 kb/s vop | 400 kb/s budget | 400 kb/s vop |
|----:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 0 | 1.002 | 0.989 | 1.003 | 0.989 |
| 12 | 0 | 1.021 | 1.016 | 1.012 | 0.996 |

| 25 | 2 | 1.001 | 1.050 | 1.001 | 1.033 |

Two-pass on a 60-frame GOP-12 / bf-2 run at 250 kb/s lands at 1.000
(single pass 1.009). The registry entry declares `encode`:
`encoder::make_encoder` / `Mpeg4VideoEncoder` (options `qp`,
`mpeg-quant`, `ac-pred`, `four-mv`, `qpel`, `bf`, `bitrate`,
`vbv-buffer`, `gop-size`, `fcode`, `mb-aq`, `packet-bits`,
`data-partitioned`, `rvlc`, `gmc`, `gmc-points`, `interlaced`, `top-field-first`,
`alt-scan`, `ecosystem-compat`, `short-header`, `gob-headers`,
`dc-vlc-thr`, `auto-dc-vlc`, `rc-mode`, `rc-band`, `pass`,
`stats-file`) is the dual-API sibling of `make_decoder`;
`Mpeg4VideoEncoder::first_pass_stats` / `with_first_pass_stats` are the
direct-API two-pass round trip.

## Compatibility modes

The decoder's default behaviour is always the **literal ISO/IEC
14496-2 text**. For the clauses below, reference decodes (FFmpeg) of
conformant streams behave differently. The **ecosystem-compat** mode
reproduces that behaviour bit-for-bit so real-world files can be
matched exactly; the registry decoder (`make_decoder`) uses it by
default. It covers exactly these divergences (`crate::compat` module
docs carry the full write-up):

1. **§7.7.2.2 interlaced direct mode** — spec: the four field MVs are
   derived from the co-located future macroblock's forward field
   motion vectors (`MV[i]`); observed: the same erratum-corrected
   derivation with those vectors read as **zero**, i.e.
   `mvf[i] = mvb[i] = MVD[0]` on the field grid (forward reference
   fields still follow the co-located selections).
2. **§7.4.4.5 mismatch control** — spec: the method-1 sum-parity
   toggle of `F[7][7]` applies to every block; observed: **non-intra
   blocks only**.
3. **§7.8.7.3 GMC averaged MV** — spec: the averaged pel-wise warping
   vector quantises to the half-/quarter-sample grid with the `//`
   rounding; observed: each **non-positive** component derives one
   MV-grid unit lower (zero included, 0 → −1; strictly positive
   components exact). Probed per component at both sample accuracies
   and pinned by the `dec_sgmc_*` fixture pairs
   (`tests/compat_gmc_amv.rs`): a full encoder-produced
   negative-trajectory S(GMC) stream decodes **bit-exact** against
   the reference decoder under ecosystem-compat.
4. **8×8 block placement** — FFmpeg clips the integer source position
   of an 8×8 prediction block (four-vector macroblocks, and direct
   macroblocks over a four-vector co-located macroblock or in a
   quarter-sample VOL) to the visible area, dropping an axis' fraction
   at its edge; where the picture does not fill its last macroblock
   row or column this moves the block.
5. **Packets** — a not-coded VOP gives no picture, nor does a B-VOP
   without a past anchor or with its times out of order; the registry
   decoder decodes the first VOP of each packet, keeps the B-VOP of a
   DivX packed bitstream for the next packet's placeholder, and shows
   the last picture of a low-delay stream that ends with a not-coded
   VOP once more.

Selection is wired through every decode surface:

* typed: `Mpeg4VideoDecoder::with_options(DecodeOptions::ecosystem())`
  (default `new()` / `DecodeOptions::spec()` is the literal spec);
  every `vop_decode` macroblock walk takes the same `DecodeOptions`;
* registry / options bag: key **`ecosystem-compat`** (bool, default
  `true`) on `CodecParameters::options`, declared by the
  `Mpeg4DecoderOptions` schema and parsed in `make_decoder`; the
  selection survives `Decoder::reset`, which keeps the headers in force
  as FFmpeg's flush does.

Measured effect (`tests/conformance.rs` `compat_*` pins): the
`mpeg_quant` I/P/B stream collapses from a 3062-sample envelope to 4
near-tie samples, the interlaced I/P/B stream from 650 samples to 7
near-ties, and the 176×144 interlaced-direct stream from 6202 samples
(max 114) to 2777 (0.29 %, max 64) with 29/30 interlaced-direct
macroblocks bit-exact, and the interlaced qpel-IPB stream (whose
direct macroblocks compensate through the §7.6.2.2 field cascade)
from 582 samples to **fully bit-exact** — the single 176×144 residual
macroblock's oracle
reconstruction is uniquely pinned by exhaustive per-field search and
is consistent with the *printed* §7.7.2.2 formulas evaluated from a
co-located field-MV state that differs from the bitstream-reconstructed
one (the co-located anchor region is flat, so that internal state is
not determinable from pixels; a docs-fixture trace ask is filed).
Streams exercising neither clause decode sample-identically in both
modes (asserted). Constructed-probe arbitration with provably
**non-zero co-located field MVs** over textured anchors
(`tests/direct_mode_probes.rs`) confirms the zero-co-located model
unconditionally for transmitted non-zero and absent `MVD[0]`; the
same probes found that a *transmitted* `MVD[0] == (0, 0)` observes
**progressive** direct mode over `Div2Round(MVf1 + MVf2)` instead —
a sub-behaviour reproduced by neither mode today (no corpus stream
contains such a macroblock; the compat decision awaits a ruling and
both modes' envelopes are pinned).

## What works today

- **End-to-end elementary-stream decode** (`decoder`):
  [`Mpeg4VideoDecoder`] (start-code scan, §6.3.5 VOP time model,
  §7.6.7 `TRB`/`TRD` derivation, `vop_coded == 0` forward-reference
  copies) plus the registry-facing [`Mpeg4PacketDecoder`] /
  [`make_decoder`] factory and a live `register()` (id `mpeg4video`,
  the common FourCC tags + MP4 OTI `0x20`).
- **Bitstream-driven macroblock walks** (`vop_decode`):
  [`decode_i_vop_macroblocks`] (running quantiser + Table 6-25
  `use_intra_dc_vlc` + per-block Figure 7-5 predictor resolution),
  [`decode_p_vop_macroblocks`], [`decode_s_gmc_vop_macroblocks`]
  (`mcsel` routing + §7.8.7.3 averaged-MV predictor recording), and
  [`decode_b_vop_macroblocks`] (§6.2.6 `co_located_not_coded`
  zero-bit macroblocks) — each with §6.2.5.2 video-packet resync
  handling (probe, header decode, §E.1.2 predictor/quantiser reset).
- **Bit-exact real-stream conformance** against a black-box reference
  decode with the ideal floating-point IDCT (`tests/conformance.rs`,
  provenance in `tests/fixtures/NOTES.md`): twelve streams bit-exact
  (including interlaced field-MC + quarter-sample), four near-exact
  (±1 near-tie IDCT samples), three bounded with root-caused oracle
  deviations — plus the full `compat_*` pin set under the
  [ecosystem-compat mode](#compatibility-modes) (two of the bounded
  streams collapse to near-tie-only under it), and seven constructed
  field-prediction **probe pins** (`tests/field_qpel_probes.rs`) that
  arbitrated and now lock the §7.7.2.1 quarter-sample
  field-interpolation geometry.
- **Configuration headers** (§6.2): Visual Object Sequence
  (`0x000001B0` + profile/level), Visual Object (`0x000001B5`, verid,
  video-signal-type, colour description), and Video Object Layer
  (`0x000001Bx`) — shape (rectangular), aspect ratio, dimensions,
  time-increment resolution, `vol_control_parameters` / VBV, the §6.2.3
  trailing flags (`interlaced`, `obmc_disable`, `sprite_enable`,
  `quant_type`, `quarter_sample`, `data_partitioned` / `reversible_vlc`,
  `scalability`, …), and the `quant_type == 1` matrix-load bodies.
- **Frame headers**: Group-of-VOP (`0x000001B3`, time code) and Video
  Object Plane (`0x000001B6`) — coding type (I / P / B / S), modulo
  time base, `vop_quant`, `vop_fcode_forward` / `_backward`, rounding
  type, and the interlaced flags.
- **Macroblock layer**: I/P-VOP macroblock-header bit-walk (mcbpc /
  cbpy / dquant / ac_pred / not-coded skip), the §6.3.6 **S(GMC)-VOP**
  macroblock layer (shares the P-VOP MCBPC table + not-coded syntax, plus
  the `mcsel` flag — GMC vs. local-MC reference selection — for inter /
  inter+q macroblocks, with the §6.3.6 implied `mcsel == 1` for a
  not-coded GMC macroblock and the §6.2.6.3 / line-11715 rule that an
  `mcsel == 1` macroblock invokes no `interlaced_information()` body),
  B-VOP header prefix (modb / mb_type / cbpb / dbquant), and the
  `interlaced_information()` body.
- **Motion vectors**: the `motion_vector()` body and MVD VLC (Table
  B.12), §7.6.3 differential reconstruction with the modulo wrap, the
  §7.6.5 median predictor with the four candidate-validity rules,
  the Figure 7-34 candidate gathering via `MvGrid`, 1-MV and Inter4V
  cardinality, chrominance-MV derivation from K luminance MVs (Tables
  7-10..7-13), and the §7.7.2.1 interlaced field-MV predictor (CASE 1 /
  2 / 3) with field-aware neighbour selection.
- **Residual + reconstruction**: intra DC prediction, AC prediction,
  the intra/inter Tcoef EVENT VLCs (Tables B.16 / B.17) with the escape
  forms, the reversible-VLC Tcoef table (Table B.23, intra + inter
  columns) with its Type-5 escape (`00001` + LAST/RUN/marker/LEVEL/marker
  + closing `0000` + sign, Tables B.24 / B.25) for the
  `reversible_vlc == 1` path in **both** the forward and the §E.1.4.4
  backward (reverse-direction) decode, zigzag / alternate scan, the
  §7.4.2 `sadct_disable == 0` modified inverse scan (`coeff_width[]`-aware
  packing with the NOTE 1 zero-fill, plus the Annex A §A.3.2 I-S1
  `coeff_width[v]` / `opaque_pels` derivation from the decoded binary
  shape), §7.4 inverse
  quantisation (methods 1 and 2), the 8×8 IDCT, the Annex A §A.3.2
  inverse **shape-adaptive DCT** (SA-DCT) transform body (steps
  I-S1..I-S5: the full shape-parameter derivation `coeff_width[v]` /
  `pels_height[x]` / `shift_shape[y][x]`, the variable-length
  `coeff_width[v]`- / `pels_height[x]`-point 1-D inverse DCT kernels,
  and the I-S3 / I-S5 column / row re-shifts) reconverting the
  `PQF[v][u]` layout back to texture `f[y][x]`, the Annex A §A.4.2 inverse
  **∆DC-SA-DCT** post-processing (steps I-∆S1..I-∆S4: extract the re-scaled
  mean `F[0][0]/8` and zero `F[0][0]`, run the inverse SA-DCT body, derive
  the ∆DC correction term `corr_term = check_sum / sqrt_sum` over the
  opaque samples, and add `mean_value − corr_term/√pels_height[x]` back per
  opaque pel — the path used for intra 8×8-blocks with `opaque_pels < 64`),
  and the §7.3 `d[y][x]` reconstruction with the display clip for I-, P-,
  and inter macroblocks.
- **B-VOP prediction + reconstruction**: forward / backward /
  interpolated / direct modes, bidirectional averaging, 16×16 luma +
  8×8 Cb / Cr prediction-block generation, and the §7.6.9 → §7.3 bridge
  ([`predict_b_vop_macroblock`] packs the prediction into an
  `InterPredictionMacroblock`; [`reconstruct_b_vop_macroblock`] runs the
  full predict + §7.3 `d = p + f` add + display clip end-to-end across
  both anchor VOPs). The §7.7.2.2 **interlaced field-prediction** B-VOP
  modes (field forward / backward / bidirectional) reconstruct to pixels
  via the `bvop_field_motion` module: the §7.7.2.2 four-PMV bank produces
  the top/bottom field MVs, [`field_forward_prediction`] /
  [`field_backward_prediction`] / [`field_bidirectional_prediction`] drive
  the §7.7.2.1 `field_motion_compensate_one_reference` per active
  direction (half- or quarter-sample luma), and the bidirectional case
  averages forward + backward with the §7.7.2.2 `(fwd + bak + 1) >> 1`
  rounding.
- **Frame-level B-VOP motion-vector decode driver** ([`BVopMvDriver`],
  `bvop_mv` module): the B-VOP analogue of the P-VOP [`MvDriver`].
  `decode_macroblock` decodes one macroblock's §6.2.6 header + motion
  bodies, resolves the §7.6.9 prediction mode, and reconstructs the
  forward / backward MVs against the §7.6.8 running per-direction
  predictor bank (reset per row via `start_row`, updated only by the
  matching direction; direct mode uses predictor zero + f_code 1 and
  §7.6.9.5.2 TRB/TRD scaling). `decode_vop_motion` walks a full
  progressive B-VOP in raster order with the row-reset threading built
  in, returning one [`BVopMbDecode`] per macroblock; the per-MB
  §7.6.9.5.1 / §7.6.9.6 co-located anchor state is supplied via a
  [`CoLocatedAnchor`] closure. [`BVopMbDecode::reconstruct`] then bridges
  the decoded motion straight into [`reconstruct_b_vop_macroblock`]. The
  §6.2.6 `modb "1"` vs `"01"` discriminator is resolved via
  [`BVopMbHeader::mb_type_present`]. [`BVopMvDriver::decode_vop`] now
  threads the §6.2.6 / §7.4 residual (texture) decode that follows each
  macroblock's motion bodies into the same raster loop: it applies each
  macroblock's `dbquant` (Table 6-33, §6.3.6) to a running quantiser
  scale and consumes the inter residual gated by the macroblock's
  `cbpb` (via [`decode_b_vop_inter_macroblock`] / [`cbpb_pattern_code`]),
  returning one [`BVopMbTexturedDecode`] (motion + residual + quantiser
  scale) per macroblock — ready to feed [`BVopMbDecode::reconstruct`].
- **GMC (global motion compensation)** end-to-end for rectangular
  S(GMC)-VOPs: the §6.2.3 `sprite_enable == "GMC"` VOL body
  (`no_of_sprite_warping_points`, `sprite_warping_accuracy`,
  `sprite_brightness_change`), the §6.2.5 `sprite_trajectory()` syntax
  (`warping_mv_code` VLC, Table B.34, → `du[i]`/`dv[i]`), the §7.8.4
  sprite reference-point + virtual-point geometry, the §7.8.5 warping
  transform `(F,G)`/`(Fc,Gc)` for 0/1/2/3 warping points (stationary /
  translation / affine — perspective is disallowed under GMC but
  supported for static sprites via `perspective_warp`), and the
  §7.8.6 sample reconstruction that bilinearly warps a reference VOP
  into a 16×16 luma / 8×8 chroma GMC prediction block with
  `vop_rounding_type` control and §7.6.4 edge clamping.
- **Frame-level decode pipeline** (§7.6.1 / §6.1.3.8): the
  [`framestore`] decoded-picture buffer — [`DecodedFrame`] owns one VOP's
  three 4:2:0 planes, blits each [`ReconstructedMacroblock`] into the
  macroblock grid, and hands out [`ReferenceVop`] plane views; [`FrameStore`]
  threads the §7.5.2.1.2 forward (past) + backward (future) anchor chain
  (`push_anchor` advances on I/P/S-VOPs, B-VOPs never enter the chain),
  selecting the single P/S reference and the bracketing B-VOP anchor pair.
  The [`frame_decode`] assemblers reconstruct a complete VOP against those
  references and blit it: `assemble_p_vop_frame` / `decode_p_vop` /
  `decode_i_vop` (forward reference), `assemble_b_vop_frame` (bracketing
  anchors), `assemble_s_gmc_vop_frame` (§7.8.7.1 per-MB warped/local
  `mcsel` selection). The [`sequence::SequenceDecoder`] applies §6.1.3.8
  VOP reordering — a one-slot anchor delay that turns a coding-order VOP
  stream into display order (`1I 4P 2B 3B` → `1I 2B 3B 4P`).
- **Half-sample / quarter-sample** motion compensation, OBMC, and the
  padding stages (sample / vertical / extended / interlaced).
- **RVLC error recovery — now driven end-to-end**: the §E.1.4.4.2.1
  two-way strategy selection — the Strategy 1–4 arbitration
  (`RvlcArbitration::select`) that picks how many macroblocks to keep
  from the forward decode at the head and from the backward decode at
  the tail, from the `L1+L2 >= L` / `N1+N2 >= N` predicates, the `f_mb` /
  `b_mb` step-inverse counters, and the threshold `T = 90` — plus the
  §E.1.4.4.2.2 intra-MB concealment pass (`displayed_mbs`). These were
  composable pieces; [`recover_video_packet_dct`] now assembles them
  into the actual recovery walk: it forward-decodes a video packet's
  DCT-coefficient region macroblock-by-macroblock (per a
  [`MbBlockLayout`] giving each MB's coded blocks + Tcoef tables),
  tracking per-MB cumulative bit costs `L1` / `N1`; on a §E.1.4.4.1
  forward error it backward-decodes from the packet end (segmenting
  EVENTs into blocks on the `LAST` flag via a non-consuming peek over a
  `Clone`d `BackwardBitReader`), gathers `L2` / `N2`, runs the
  arbitration, and returns a `RvlcRecovery::Recovered`.
  [`RvlcRecovery::stitch`] then collapses the recovery into the final
  per-macroblock decode set — applying the keep decision (errored middle
  discarded) and the §E.1.4.4.2.2 INTRA concealment. **The recovery now
  reaches pixels**: the data-partitioned P-VOP walk catches a texture
  (partition-3) error on a `reversible_vlc == 1` VOL, locates the
  packet's DCT-region end (`texture_region_end`), runs the two-way
  recovery, reconstructs every kept inter macroblock from its recovered
  EVENT runs (`recovered_inter_macroblock` → the shared §7.4
  inter-block tail), conceals discarded/INTRA macroblocks (trusted
  partition-1 motion + zero residual; skipped-style zero-MV copy for a
  concealed intra), and resumes bit-exactly at the next video packet
  (`tests/rvlc_recovery_frame.rs` drives a truncated-texture packet
  end-to-end through the walk).
- **§6.2.5.3 data partitioning**: [`parse_data_partitioned_i_vop`] /
  [`parse_data_partitioned_p_vop`] walk the rectangular data-partitioned
  I-/P-VOP layouts — partition 1 (`mcbpc` + `dquant` + intra-DC, or
  `not_coded` + `mcbpc` + `mcsel` + `motion_coding`) to the §6.3.5
  19-bit `dc_marker` / 17-bit `motion_marker`, then partition 2
  (`ac_pred_flag` + `cbpy` [+ `dquant` + intra-DC for P]) — and return
  the bit offset of the partition-3 `block()` texture region.
  [`use_intra_dc_vlc`] transcribes the Table 6-25 derivation; the
  [`mb_block_layout`] bridge turns a parsed MB into the [`MbBlockLayout`]
  the RVLC driver consumes, closing the data-partitioned bitstream →
  texture-decode loop.

## Not yet supported

- S(GMC)-VOPs on the data-partitioned layout are coded and decoded
  per the printed §6.2.5.3 `data_partitioned_p_vop()` (`mcsel` after
  `mcbpc`, no `motion_coding()` on GMC macroblocks); the deployed
  reference decoder does not read those clauses (it desynchronises at
  the first macroblock of a data-partitioned S-VOP — see
  `tests/fixtures/NOTES.md`), so the combination is oracle-verified
  only (the §E.1.4.4 RVLC two-way recovery runs on S(GMC) packets
  too: a discarded macroblock keeps its trusted GMC / local
  prediction with a zero residual).
- Interlaced data partitioning / RVLC — **not codable by the
  standard**, not a gap: ISO/IEC 14496-2 Annex G Table G.2 note e)
  ("Interlace does not support Data Partitioning nor RVLC") and the
  §6.2.5.3 `data_partitioned_i_vop()` / `data_partitioned_p_vop()`
  syntax, which carries no `interlaced_information()` (no `dct_type`,
  no `field_prediction`). The encoder rejects the combination with a
  typed error citing the note; the decoder's data-partitioned walks
  reject an `interlaced == 1` VOL the same way.
- Encoder: the two-pass statistics are per VOP (no per-macroblock
  first-pass profile — the second pass allots inside a VOP by source
  activity); the `intra_dc_vlc_thr` election under budget regulation
  is a measured estimate (the probe's quantiser sequence is the
  threshold-0 one). The decoder-side feature set below is unchanged.

- §E.1.4.4 recovery on **I-VOP** texture partitions (an I-VOP texture
  error still propagates: §E.1.4.4.2.2 conceals every INTRA macroblock
  of an errored packet, and an I-VOP has no inter macroblocks to
  recover — a concealment source for that case needs a policy
  decision). The **P-VOP** path is wired end-to-end (see above).
- The final routing of the §7.3.5 / Table 7-2 per-block transform
  selection from a *live decoded shape* inside the macroblock
  reconstruction loop. The decision rule itself is now implemented
  ([`transform_select`]: `select_transform` transcribes the three Table
  7-2 rows — 8×8-DCT for rectangular / `sadct_disable == 1` /
  `opaque_pels == 64`; ∆DC-SA-DCT for non-B intra blocks; SA-DCT for
  P-VOP inter and all B-VOP blocks — and `inverse_transform_block` /
  `select_and_inverse_transform` apply the chosen one of the three
  transform bodies). What remains is calling it from the residual loop
  with the per-block `opaque_pels` count and `f_shape` derived from the
  decoded binary shape of the current macroblock.
- The §7.8.3 low-latency static-sprite piece-update machinery. The
  **basic** static sprite (`low_latency_sprite_enable == 0`) warps the
  §7.8.2 sprite memory onto the visible VOP via the §7.8.6 static blend
  (incl. the `brightness_change_factor` post-adjustment). The
  **low-latency** syntax shell is now parsed too: `sprite_piece` decodes
  the §6.2.5.4 `decode_sprite_piece()` header (`piece_quant` /
  `piece_width` / `piece_height` / `piece_xoffset` / `piece_yoffset`),
  the Table 6-26 `sprite_transmit_mode` (stop / piece / update / pause)
  with its `do {…} while` piece loop (`drive_sprite_piece_loop`), the
  Table B.35 `brightness_change_factor()` VLC, and the composed §6.2.5
  static S-VOP block (`parse_static_sprite_vop_block` — trajectory +
  brightness + piece loop). The §7.8.5 **four-point perspective** warp
  (`perspective_warp::PerspectiveWarp`, the
  `no_of_sprite_warping_points == 4` case) is implemented and wired into
  static-sprite reconstruction (`static_sprite_luma_perspective`). The
  §7.8.3.1 / §7.8.3.2 **hole handling** is modelled by
  `SpriteObjectBuffer`: it tracks the per-macroblock `send_mb()`
  occupancy of the sprite-object grid (`object_piece_new_macroblocks`
  returns the new MBs an object-piece carries a body for, skipping holes
  already sent by an earlier piece) and validates update-pieces
  (`update_piece_refined_macroblocks` — every refined MB's object MB must
  already exist, per the §7.8.3.2 ordering rule). What remains end-to-end
  is decoding each piece's `sprite_shape_texture()` macroblock body into
  sprite memory (the object-piece I-VOP / update-piece P-VOP macroblock
  texture subset).
- Scalability enhancement layers and non-rectangular shapes (rejected
  with typed errors). The Simple Studio Profile (10-bit intra VOPs, DCT
  or DPCM macroblocks) decodes through the registry decoder only
  (`studio`, an FFmpeg port). GMC global-motion warping *is*
  supported; the §6.3.6 `mcsel` flag is now routed into the §7.3 recon
  loop (`s_gmc_recon::s_gmc_prediction_macroblock` selects warped vs.
  translational per-MB), and the §7.8.7.3 averaged MV predictor and the
  §7.6.8 four-PMV interlaced-B-VOP field predictor are implemented.
- Brightness change in GMC/sprite warping (`brightness_change_factor()`
  / `sprite_brightness_change == 1`) — typed-rejected, since the spec
  mandates `sprite_brightness_change == 0` under GMC.

## Fuzzing

`fuzz/` is a `cargo-fuzz` sub-crate (nightly): `short_header` drives
the §6.2.5.2 picture parser, the GOB / macroblock walk and the stream
decoder's VOL-less auto-detection on arbitrary bytes; `stream_decode`
feeds whole elementary streams to `Mpeg4VideoDecoder`, raw and behind
a fixed VOS/VOL prefix so the VOP headers, video-packet HEC bodies,
data partitioning and every macroblock walk get exercised;
`first_pass_stats` drives the `rate_control::FirstPassStats` text
parser (the `stats-file` a `pass=2` encoder reads) and plans a
sequence from whatever parses; `encode_roundtrip` lets the bytes pick
the picture size, the tool set (budget / reactive rate control,
`mb-aq`, video packets, data partitioning incl. S(GMC), RVLC, GMC
points, B-VOPs, qpel, 4MV, fcode, interlaced tools, method-1
quantisation, `intra_dc_vlc_thr`, short header) and the content of
two to four tiny frames, encodes through the registry encoder and
requires the crate's own decoder to read every frame back. The `Fuzz`
workflow runs all four daily through the org-level reusable job.
