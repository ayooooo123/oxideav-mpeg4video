# Changelog

All notable changes to this crate are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the crate adheres
to [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `Decoder::output_video_dimensions` / `output_pixel_format`: the visible
  size of the frame last returned (the VOL's
  `video_object_layer_width` × `_height`, or a short-header picture's
  source format), `Yuv420P`; before the first, the next frame in display
  order. Frames carry it as `DecodedFrame::visible_size`. The planes stay
  macroblock-padded.

## [0.1.8](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-mpeg4video/compare/v0.1.7...v0.1.8) - 2026-09-11

### Other

- §E.1.4.4 backward RVLC pass treats a non-LAST opening EVENT as a detected backward error (truncated / corrupted region tail) instead of a debug assertion — fixes the debug-build CI failure of the S(GMC) truncated-texture test
- interlaced budget-mode black-box pair — budget-driven dquant/dbquant on an interlaced + qpel (ecosystem-compat) IPB stream, ×1.012 of target at 33.17 dB, bit-exact in the reference decoder
- §E.1.4.4 RVLC two-way recovery on data-partitioned S(GMC) packets — the P-layout recovery runs over the trusted partition 1, recovered residuals map back onto the GMC / local / concealed-intra macroblock kinds; truncated-texture test keeps every prediction kind
- mpeg4video fuzz: first_pass_stats (stats-file parser + BudgetPlanner) and encode_roundtrip (fuzzer-chosen tool sets through the registry encoder, read back by the own decoder) targets — 240 s / 480 s bounded runs clean
- S(GMC)-VOPs on the §6.2.5.3 data-partitioned layout both ways — decoder DP S walk (mcsel / GMC clauses in partition 1 driving the §7.6.5 driver + §7.8.7.3 averaged MVs, P-layout partitions 2/3, RVLC forward decode) wired into the stream decoder, encoder S-VOPs on the PartitionedP layout; gmc + data-partitioned (+ rvlc, packets) accepted, sample-exact through the own walk; black-box observation: the reference decoder desyncs at the first macroblock of a partitioned S-VOP, no pair pinned
- interlaced + data partitioning ruled not codable by ISO/IEC 14496-2 (Annex G Table G.2 note e; §6.2.5.3 carries no interlaced_information()) — typed rejection cites the note, README moves it from the gaps to the spec rulings
- mpeg4video encoder: intra_dc_vlc_thr elected over the whole Table 6-25 — one probe encode costs every macroblock under both DC-differential VLCs (DcVlcProbe), the eight thresholds are scored against the per-macroblock running quantisers (elect_intra_dc_vlc_thr), exact under constant / activity-classed quantisers; mid-table winners appear under budget regulation
- budget-driven rate control black-box pairs — one-pass (×1.006, 33.49 dB) and two-pass (×1.000, 33.62 dB) IPB streams with budget-driven dquant/dbquant bit-exact in the reference decoder; tests/ + fuzz/ excluded from the package
- mpeg4video encoder: budget-driven rate control — GOP bit budgets split by a per-class bits×qp complexity model (BudgetPlanner: trailing B-VOPs charged to their GOP, one-second carry, first-VOP calibration, VBV clamp), per-macroblock dquant/dbquant regulation against an activity-weighted expected-spend curve (MbRegulator, rc-band), two-pass via FirstPassStats (pass/stats-file + direct API); rc-mode=vop keeps the reactive controller; rate accuracy matrix across GOP shapes
- fix two intra-doc links in bvop_interlaced_encode
- interlaced S(GMC)-VOPs both ways — decoder S walk on interlaced VOLs (field-predicted local MBs, field DCT on GMC residuals, §6.2.6.3 dct_type read on coded mcsel==1 MBs), encoder interlaced+gmc with field-local candidates over the AMV predictors; black-box bit-exact pair
- cargo-fuzz harness — short_header (§6.2.5.2 parser + walk + VOL-less auto-detect) and stream_decode (raw + VOS/VOL-prefixed elementary streams) targets, 240 s each clean locally; Fuzz workflow shim over the org reusable job
- Table 6-25 intra_dc_vlc_thr on the encoder (explicit + measured election, combined and data-partitioned layouts) + S(GMC)-VOP packet HEC bodies restating sprite_trajectory() both ways; data-partitioned parsers decide use_intra_dc_vlc per macroblock after dquant; black-box bit-exact pair
- mpeg4video encoder: GMC with two / three warping points — §7.8.5 similarity / affine trajectory fitting (mode-seeded robust least squares + coordinate-descent refinement on the decoder's warp), gmc-points option, quantiser-scaled GMC preference; three-point stream black-box bit-exact, two-point exact up to one intra near-tie
- §6.2.5.2 short header (H.263-compatible) both ways — VOL-less stream auto-detect + I/P picture decode (GOB headers, 8-bit intra DC, Table B.17 + Type-4 escapes, §7.6.5 GOB predictor rule), short-header / gob-headers encoder options; black-box bit-exact in both directions
- mpeg4video encoder: interlaced tools — field DCT, §7.7.2.1 field-predicted P macroblocks, §7.7.2.2 field / interlaced-direct B modes, interlaced_information() emission; black-box bit-exact I+P and compat I/P/B pairs; decoder §7.6.3 field-vector wrap + §7.6.4 frame-grid qpel field clamp

### Added

- Encoder: budget-driven rate control (`rc-mode=budget`, the new
  default under `bitrate`): `rate_control::BudgetPlanner` allots a bit
  budget per GOP and splits it over the GOP's remaining I/P/B-VOPs by
  a per-class `bits × qp` complexity model (trailing B-VOPs charged to
  their own GOP, surplus / deficit carried at one second's worth per
  second, first VOP of each class re-encoded once when it misses its
  target by more than a quarter), clamps every target against the
  Annex D VBV occupancy and hands it to the macroblock loop as an
  `mb_quant::MbBudget`; `mb_quant::MbRegulator` then drives the
  per-macroblock `dquant` / `dbquant` steps from the spend against an
  activity-weighted expected-spend curve (`rc-band` half-width around
  `vop_quant`, `mb-aq` activity classes stack on top). Two-pass:
  `pass=1` writes `rate_control::FirstPassStats` (`stats-file`, a
  line-oriented text form) at flush, `pass=2` plans each VOP's share
  of the sequence budget from the measured complexities;
  `Mpeg4VideoEncoder::first_pass_stats` / `with_first_pass_stats` for
  the direct API. `rc-mode=vop` keeps the previous per-VOP reactive
  controller. Measured over 50 frames: budget mode within 0.2 % of
  the target on intra-only / GOP-25 shapes and within 4 % on GOP-12
  IPB (reactive mode: up to 8 %); two-pass 1.000. Encode statistics
  (`IVopEncodeStats`, the P/S/B stats) now carry the coded
  macroblocks' quantiser sum. Two new black-box pairs
  (`enc_ipb_rcbudget_96x64` one-pass ×1.006 of the target at 33.49 dB,
  `enc_ipb_rc2pass_96x64` two-pass ×1.000 at 33.62 dB,
  `enc_ilaced_rcbudget_compat_96x64` interlaced + qpel ×1.012 at
  33.17 dB), all bit-exact in the reference decoder.
- Manifest: `tests/` and `fuzz/` are excluded from the published
  package.
- S(GMC)-VOPs on the §6.2.5.3 data-partitioned layout, both ways:
  `vop_decode::decode_s_gmc_vop_macroblocks_dp` (partition 1 with the
  `mcsel` / GMC clauses driving the §7.6.5 driver and §7.8.7.3
  averaged MVs, partitions 2/3 on the P layout, RVLC forward decode)
  wired into the stream decoder, the encoder's S-VOPs take the
  `PartitionedP` layout (`mcsel` after `mcbpc` in partition 1) —
  `gmc` + `data-partitioned` (+ `rvlc`, `packet-bits`) is accepted;
  sample-exact through the crate's own walk; the §E.1.4.4 RVLC
  two-way recovery runs on S(GMC) packets (a discarded macroblock
  keeps its trusted GMC / local prediction). Black-box: the reference
  decoder does not read the S(GMC) clauses of the partitioned syntax
  (desync at the first macroblock), so no reference pair is pinned.
- Encoder `auto-dc-vlc`: the `intra_dc_vlc_thr` election now covers
  the whole Table 6-25 — one probe encode costs every macroblock
  under both DC-differential VLCs (`ivop_encode::DcVlcProbe`), the
  eight thresholds are scored against the per-macroblock running
  quantisers (`elect_intra_dc_vlc_thr`) and the cheapest is coded
  (previously only 0 and 7 were compared); the election is exact
  under constant / activity-classed quantisers.

- Encoder: interlaced tools — `interlaced` VOL with per-VOP
  `top_field_first` / `alternate_vertical_scan_flag`, per-macroblock
  §7.7.1 field DCT (`dct_type`) election, §7.7.2.1 field-predicted P
  macroblocks (per-field estimation against both reference parities,
  CASE 1/2/3 predictor on the field grid), §7.7.2.2 interlaced B-VOPs
  (field forward / backward / bidirectional through the four-PMV bank,
  interlaced direct with the Table 7-16 field-period scaling), §6.2.6.3
  `interlaced_information()` emission; registry options `interlaced`,
  `top-field-first`, `alt-scan`, `ecosystem-compat` (the latter avoids
  the interlaced-direct syntax whose deployed reading diverges from the
  text). Three new black-box fixture pairs: interlaced I+P and compat
  I/P/B bit-exact; the spec-literal I/P/B + qpel stream diverges only
  inside interlaced-direct macroblocks and is bit-exact under the
  crate's ecosystem-compat decode.

- Short header (§6.2.5.2, `short_video_header == 1`) both ways: the
  stream decoder auto-detects a VOL-less `short_video_start_marker`
  stream and decodes its I/P pictures (Table 6-28 fixed tools, Table
  6-29 source formats, GOB headers with the §7.6.5 GOB predictor rule,
  8-bit intra DC, Table B.17 + Type-4 escapes); the encoder's
  `short-header` / `gob-headers` options emit the same syntax. Two
  black-box pairs: our stream decodes bit-exact in the reference
  decoder, a reference-encoder H.263 stream decodes bit-exact in ours.

- GMC with two and three warping points (`gmc-points`): the S(GMC)
  encoder fits the §7.8.5 similarity / affine model to its motion
  field (mode-seeded robust least squares, coordinate-descent
  refinement on the decoder's own warp) and emits the multi-point
  `sprite_trajectory()`; the GMC-vs-local preference now scales with
  the quantiser. Black-box pairs: the three-point stream is bit-exact
  in the reference decoder, the two-point stream exact up to one
  intra near-tie sample.

- Encoder `intra_dc_vlc_thr` (Table 6-25): explicit `dc-vlc-thr` 0..=7
  (intra DC differentials on the AC VLC above the running-quantiser
  threshold, combined and data-partitioned layouts) and `auto-dc-vlc`
  (per-I-VOP election by measured cost, carried to the following
  P/S-VOPs).
- S(GMC)-VOP video-packet HEC bodies: the encoder restates
  `sprite_trajectory()` and the decoder's `video_packet_header()`
  parser consumes it (`VideoPacketHeader::sprite_trajectory`). New
  black-box pair `enc_isb_dcvlc7_hec_96x64`, bit-exact.

- `fuzz/` sub-crate (cargo-fuzz) with two targets — `short_header`
  (§6.2.5.2 picture parser + macroblock walk + VOL-less stream
  auto-detection) and `stream_decode` (whole elementary streams, raw
  and behind a fixed VOS/VOL prefix) — plus the `Fuzz` workflow shim
  over the org reusable fuzz job.

- Interlaced S(GMC)-VOPs both ways: the decoder's S walk accepts
  interlaced VOLs (field-predicted `mcsel == 0` macroblocks, field DCT
  on any coded residual, `SGmcMbContent::FieldLocal`), the encoder's
  `interlaced` + `gmc` combination is accepted (field-local candidates
  against the GMC neighbours' averaged MVs, `dct_type` election on GMC
  residuals), and interlaced B-VOPs consume the S anchors' field
  motion. New black-box pair `enc_isb_ilaced_gmc_compat_96x64`,
  bit-exact.

- Fuzz targets `first_pass_stats` (the `stats-file` parser + planner)
  and `encode_roundtrip` (fuzzer-chosen tool sets through the registry
  encoder, decoded back by the crate's own decoder): 240 s / 480 s
  bounded runs clean locally.

### Changed

- Interlaced + data-partitioned is documented as not codable by the
  standard (ISO/IEC 14496-2 Table G.2 note e); §6.2.5.3 carries no
  `interlaced_information()`): the encoder's rejection now cites the
  note and the README lists it under the spec rulings rather than the
  gaps.

### Fixed

- §E.1.4.4 RVLC recovery: a backward pass whose first EVENT is not a
  `LAST` (the region's own tail truncated or corrupted) is now a
  detected backward-direction error — the stitch falls back to the
  forward decode — instead of a debug-build assertion failure.

- Decoder: an `mcsel == 1` macroblock of an interlaced S(GMC)-VOP now
  reads its §6.2.6.3 `dct_type` bit when `cbp != 0` (§6.2.6's
  `interlaced_information()` line is unconditional; only the
  `field_prediction` gate carries the `!mcsel` clause) — the parser
  used to skip the whole body, mis-parsing every coded GMC macroblock
  of an interlaced stream; the reference decoder reads the bit too.
- Decoder: the §6.2.5.3 data-partitioned I-/P-VOP parsers evaluate
  `use_intra_dc_vlc` per macroblock against the running quantiser
  after that macroblock's `dquant` (§6.3.5 "the DCT quantiser"),
  instead of once per video packet — an `intra_dc_vlc_thr` in 1..=6
  with `dquant` moves mis-parsed the partition.
- Decoder: a §7.7.2.1 field motion vector is reconstructed under the
  §7.6.3 `[low:high]` modulo wrap on its own grid (horizontal in frame
  units, vertical in field units), as §7.6.3 declares its process valid
  for interlaced VOPs — black-box-arbitrated on encoder-produced streams.
- Decoder: a quarter-sample field read past the plane edge clamps to
  the VOP's edge line on the frame grid (§7.6.4), matching the
  half-sample field `mc` routine — previously clamped within the field.

### Added

- **Compat divergence 3 — §7.8.7.3 GMC averaged MV (round 452)** —
  the opt-in ecosystem-compat mode now reproduces the deployed
  reference decoder's averaged-MV derivation: each **non-positive**
  component comes out one MV-grid unit lower than the spec
  quantisation (zero included, 0 → −1; strictly positive components
  exact), probed per component at half- and quarter-sample with
  crafted GMC-neighbour + zero-MVD-local streams and re-clipped to
  the Table 7-9 range. Wired through `gmc_averaged_mv` (S(GMC) walk +
  the B frame-direct co-located substitution that consumes those
  AMVs); the default stays spec-literal and the encoder's closed
  loop keeps mirroring it. Pinned by three committed fixture pairs
  (`dec_sgmc_negamv_hp_64x64`, `dec_sgmc_negamv_qp_64x64`,
  `dec_sgmc_negtraj_96x64` — the last a full encoder-produced
  negative-trajectory S(GMC) stream that decodes **bit-exact**
  against the reference decoder under ecosystem-compat on every
  frame, while the spec-literal decode diverges exactly where the
  rule bites; `tests/compat_gmc_amv.rs`).

- **GMC (sprite trajectory) emission (round 452)** — new `svop_encode`
  module: with `EncoderConfig::gmc` / registry option `gmc`,
  non-keyframe anchors become **S(GMC)-VOPs** (verid-2 VOL,
  `sprite_enable == "GMC"`, one §7.8.4 warping point at half-pel
  accuracy). The global translation is estimated as the dominant
  per-MB §7.6 motion vector, clamped into the Table 7-9 range so the
  §7.8.7.3 averaged-MV clip can never fire, and emitted as the
  §6.2.5 `sprite_trajectory()` (`put_warping_mv_code`, the exact
  Table B.34 inverse); per macroblock the §7.8.7.1 GMC prediction
  (built by the decoder's own warp) competes with local §7.6
  candidates and intra activity, emitting `mcsel`, the §6.3.6
  `not_coded` GMC copy, or the plain local path; GMC macroblocks
  record the §7.8.7.3 averaged MV into the predictor grid exactly as
  the decoder does, and B-VOPs bracket S anchors through the same
  co-located mapping the stream decoder applies. Works with
  quarter-sample, adaptive quant, `fcode > 1` and video packets (an
  S-VOP packet header never carries the HEC body — it would restate
  `sprite_trajectory()`, which the packet-header parser does not
  consume). `tests/encoder_gmc.rs` + the black-box pair
  `enc_isb_gmc_qpel_96x64` decoded bit-exact by the reference
  decoder.

### Fixed

- **Table B.34 `warping_mv_code` layout (round 452)** — the sprite
  trajectory reader treated `dmv_length` as a plain unary run of
  one-bits; Table B.34 actually assigns `00` → 0, `010`..`110` →
  1..=5, and `SSS − 3` one-bits + `0` for 6..=14. Every GMC /
  static-sprite trajectory decode used the wrong VLC. Found by
  black-box validation of the new S(GMC) encoder (crafted
  pure-GMC-copy streams now decode bit-exact through the reference
  binary); both directions fixed, all crafted-bit tests rewritten to
  the table layout.

### Notes

- **§7.8.7.3 negative averaged-MV ecosystem divergence (round 452)** —
  black-box probing shows the deployed reference decoder derives each
  *negative* averaged-MV component of a GMC macroblock one
  half-sample lower than the spec's §7.8.7.3 quantisation (positives
  exact; measured du −2→−3, −3→−4, −4→−5, −10→−11 on crafted
  GMC-neighbour probes). This alters the §7.6.5 predictor of local
  macroblocks next to GMC ones and the §7.6.9 frame-direct
  substitution over S anchors. The decoder keeps the spec-literal
  behaviour (per the crate's compatibility policy); extending the
  opt-in ecosystem-compat mode to cover it (including the unprobed
  quarter-sample rule) is recorded as a follow-up in
  `tests/fixtures/NOTES.md`.

- **Round-452 stress sweep + README (stage 4)** — `tests/encoder_stress.rs`
  gains the resilient tool set (fcode 3 + dquant / dbquant + 200-bit
  video packets + data partitioning + RVLC on top of inter4v +
  quarter-sample + B-VOPs) over the adversarial content matrix (noise
  at qp 1 / 31 forcing the RVLC Type-5 escape and the dquant clip,
  saturated flats collapsing to skips / zero-bit macroblocks around
  packet cuts, 1×1 checkerboards, bars, partial-edge / single- /
  1-bit-`macroblock_number` grids), and the registry run adds
  `fcode` 2 + `mb-aq` + packets + DP + RVLC to rate control. README
  encoder section and "Not yet supported" rewritten for the round-452
  tool set.

- **Encoder error-resilience emission (round 452)** — new
  `packet_encode` module: every I-/P-VOP macroblock is described as an
  `MbFields` record and laid out by a `PacketWriter` that owns the
  syntax (combined `macroblock()` order, or the §6.2.5.3
  `data_partitioned_i_vop()` / `data_partitioned_p_vop()` partitions
  with the `dc_marker` / `motion_marker` between them). Video packets
  (`EncoderConfig::resilience.packet_bits` / option `packet-bits`) are
  cut at the first macroblock boundary past the size target: §5.2.5
  stuffing, the §6.3.3 `resync_marker` of the VOP type / fcode length,
  `macroblock_number` (Table 6-27 width), `quant_scale`, and a
  `header_extension_code` body alternating packet by packet (restated
  `modulo_time_base` / `vop_time_increment` / `vop_coding_type` /
  `intra_dc_vlc_thr` / fcodes); the intra grid, motion-vector grid, B
  running predictors and running quantiser reset exactly as the
  decoder's walks do. Data partitioning (`data-partitioned`) and the
  reversible VLC texture partition (`rvlc`; Table B.23 inverse lookup
  + the Type-5 escape, `vlc_encode::put_ac_events_rvlc`, exhaustively
  round-tripped against `decode_ac_event_rvlc`) are VOL flags now
  written by `write_configuration_headers`; B-VOPs keep the combined
  syntax inside a partitioned VOL (§6.2.5.3 NOTE) but still cut
  packets. `BitWriter::append` splices partition writers bit-exactly;
  `VopCodingType::to_bits` is the header-field inverse. New
  `tests/encoder_resilience.rs` (packets under every fcode, packets +
  dquant re-seeding, DP single-/multi-packet under both quantisation
  methods, RVLC with every tool at qp 2/12/31, B-VOPs in a DP+RVLC
  VOL, registry wiring incl. the `rvlc`-needs-`data-partitioned`
  guard, and a corrupted RVLC texture partition still decoding through
  the §E.1.4.4 recovery) plus three black-box pairs
  (`enc_ipb_vp_fcode2_96x64`, `enc_ip_dp_aq_96x48`,
  `enc_ipb_dprvlc_aq4mv_96x48`) decoded bit-exact by the reference
  decoder. Every previously pinned fixture still reproduces
  byte-for-byte through the new writer.

- **Encoder per-macroblock quantiser modulation (round 452)** —
  `EncoderConfig::adaptive_quant` / registry option `mb-aq`: the new
  `mb_quant` module classes each macroblock's mean-removed luma
  activity into a ±2 quantiser offset around the VOP quantiser and
  plans the §6.3.7 running-quantiser step against it — `dquant`
  (Table 6-32, `{−2, −1, +1, +2}`) on I-/P-VOP macroblocks emitted as
  the Table B.6/B.7 `intra+q` / `inter+q` types (inter4v carries no
  `dquant` and keeps the running value; skips leave it untouched), and
  `dbquant` (Table 6-33, `{−2, 0, +2}`) on non-direct coded B-VOP
  macroblocks (the only place the B running quantiser moves). Every
  block is quantised at the macroblock's own quantiser and the intra
  neighbour grid records it, so the §7.4.3 cross-quantiser predictor
  scaling is mirrored. `PVopEncodeStats::dquant` /
  `BVopEncodeStats::dbquant` count the carried steps. New
  `tests/encoder_adaptive_quant.rs` (both quantisation methods,
  inter4v + quarter-sample, B-VOP `dbquant`, registry path) and the
  black-box pair `enc_ipb_aq4mv_96x48` decoded bit-exact by the
  reference decoder.

- **Encoder `fcode > 1` motion ranges (round 452)** — `EncoderConfig::fcode`
  / registry option `fcode` (1..=7) emits `vop_fcode_forward` (P) and
  `vop_fcode_forward` + `vop_fcode_backward` (B) and moves the §7.6
  motion search onto the Table 7-9 range for that fcode
  (`[-32·2^(fcode-1), 32·2^(fcode-1) - 1]` in half- or quarter-sample
  units): a coarse 4-pel lattice over the whole window followed by
  dense refinement, then the existing half-/quarter-sample ring
  passes clamped to the range; inter4v block vectors share the
  window. Differentials ride the §6.2.6.2 `r_size`-bit residual form
  after the §7.6.3 modulo wrap. `fcode == 1` output is byte-identical
  to before (every pinned fixture still reproduces). New
  `tests/encoder_fcode.rs` (20/24-pel translations found at fcode
  2/3, every fcode × sample mode round-trips sample-exact, registry
  P+B path) and two black-box pairs (`enc_ip_fcode2_96x64`,
  `enc_ipb_fcode3_qpel4mv_96x64`) decoded bit-exact by the reference
  decoder.

- **Encoder robustness sweep for the round-443 tool set (stage 5)** —
  `tests/encoder_stress.rs` gains I/B/P round-trips with inter4v +
  quarter-sample + B-VOPs enabled together over the adversarial
  content matrix (full-range noise, 1×1 checkerboards, saturated
  flats, hard bars; qp 1/31, both quantisation methods, partial-edge
  and single-macroblock grids) — all sample-exact against the
  closed-loop reconstructions — plus a registry-level
  four-mv + qpel + bf 2 + rate-control noise run pinning display
  order and byte-determinism.

- **Annex D rate control (round 443, stage 4)** — `rate_control`:
  the normative D.2 video-rate-buffer model simulated on the encoder
  side (`B = 16384 × vbv_buffer_size`; peak-rate channel
  `Rvol <= 400 × bit_rate` filling `min(B − b, R·Δt)` per decode
  interval, so overflow is structurally impossible; instantaneous
  item-6 removals; the item-8 `b_0` seed including the §6.2.1
  configuration bits; real-valued arithmetic per item 9) plus a
  bit-budget-regulated quantiser adaptation (encoder freedom):
  per-VOP budget = channel refill + a proportional correction
  steering occupancy to the two-thirds operating point (the Annex D
  default `vbv_occupancy = 170 × vbv_buffer_size`), multiplicative
  qp scaling bounded ±2 per VOP, and an item-9 admission gate — a
  VOP larger than the current occupancy is **re-encoded** at a
  coarsened quantiser (+4 per step, saturating at 31) before its
  packet is surfaced. Registry options `bitrate` (bits/s; 0 =
  constant qp) and `vbv-buffer` (16384-bit units; 0 = auto: two
  seconds at the target); the VOL now emits the §6.2.3
  `vbv_parameters` triple (30-bit rate in 400-bit units, 18-bit
  buffer size, 26-bit occupancy, with the marker layout mirrored
  from the crate's own parser). Validation (`tests/encoder_rate.rs`):
  measured rate lands inside [0.6, 1.1]× target on a moving scene at
  150/400 kb/s; an **independent Annex D re-simulation from the
  emitted packet sizes** proves `d_i < B` and no underflow across the
  run; stream sizes grow monotonically with the target; bf-2 +
  rate-control streams decode in display order and re-encode
  byte-identically.

- **B-VOP encoder end-to-end (round 443, stage 3)** — `bvop_encode`:
  per-macroblock §7.6.9 mode decision (direct with an `MVD` window
  search over the §7.6.9.5.2 TRB/TRD derivation from the co-located
  future-anchor vectors; forward / backward via the §7.6 motion search
  against each anchor; interpolated), every candidate scored on the
  prediction the decoder's own machinery generates
  (`BVopMbDecode::reconstruct` with a zero residual). Emission follows
  §6.2.6: `modb` (Table B.3, `"1"` for a direct zero-delta macroblock
  with no coded blocks), Table B.4 `mb_type`, `cbpb`, `dbquant`
  (Table 6-33, delta 0), the motion bodies against the §7.6.8 running
  per-direction predictors (row-reset; direct coded with predictor
  zero + `f_code` 1), Table B.17 residuals — and the §6.2.6
  `co_located_not_coded` **zero-bit** form when the co-located
  future-P macroblock was skipped. The registry encoder gains the
  `bf` option (0..=8 B-VOPs between anchors): a display-order reorder
  queue, anchors coded first (I per `gop-size` cadence, else P), the
  bracketed B run after, §6.3.5 anchor/B time bases mirroring the
  decoder's model, and Annex D item-7 decode-time stamps
  (`dts == pts` for `bf == 0`; anchor `dts` = previous anchor's
  composition time otherwise). The VOL now declares
  `vol_control_parameters` with `low_delay == 0` when B-VOPs are in
  play; B streams select the ASP profile. Every emitted B unit is
  decoded back through `decode_b_vop_macroblocks` +
  `assemble_b_vop_frame` (closed loop). This encoder emits
  progressive B-VOPs only, where the §7.7.2.2 interlaced-direct
  compat divergence cannot arise.
  Validation (`tests/encoder_b_vop.rs`): I/B/P streams (plain, qpel,
  method-1, both) self-decode **sample-exact** against the closed-loop
  reconstructions; a static scene over an all-skip P collapses to an
  all-zero-bit B unit (≤ 8 bytes); registry `bf` 2 round-trips 8
  frames in display order with monotone `dts <= pts` and the coded
  order `I0 P3 B1 B2 P6 B4 B5 P7`; byte-determinism. A new black-box
  pair (`enc_ipb_64x64`) pins that the reference decoder's decode of
  our I/P/B stream is **bit-exact** against this crate's own.

- **Encoder 4MV + quarter-sample motion (round 443, stages 1–2)** —
  the encoder tail's first two arms:
  - *§6.3.7 inter4v emission* (`four-mv` option / `EncoderConfig::
    four_mv`): per-8×8-block motion estimation (a full-pel window
    around the 1-MV winner + the sub-pel refinement), cost-decided
    against the 1-MV form, emitted as Table B.7 `derived_mb_type == 2`
    with four `motion_vector()` bodies — each against the §7.6.5
    median for *that* block index with the in-MB Figure 7-34
    candidates threaded incrementally, mirroring the decoder's
    `MvDriver::decode_four_mv` exactly.
  - *§7.6.2.2 quarter-sample emission* (`qpel` option /
    `EncoderConfig::quarter_sample`): the VOL declares verid 2 (the
    §6.2.3 `quarter_sample` flag exists only under
    `video_object_layer_verid != 1`, widening `sprite_enable` to two
    bits and adding the `newpred_enable` /
    `reduced_resolution_vop_enable` pair) and the ASP profile
    (Table G.1 `0xF3` / Table 6-11 `0x11`); motion estimation refines
    full-pel → half-pel → quarter-pel through the decoder's own
    §7.6.2.2 interpolator (16×16 single-block for 1-MV, per-8×8
    Figure 7-30 mirroring for inter4v), clamped to the `fcode == 1`
    quarter-unit range; `reconstruct_own_p_vop` follows the VOL's
    sample mode.
  - Validation: divergent-block-motion and fractional-motion scenes
    self-decode **sample-exact** through `Mpeg4VideoDecoder` in all
    tool combinations (4MV, qpel, qpel+4MV), byte-deterministic; three
    new black-box fixture pairs (`enc_ip_4mv_64x64`,
    `enc_ip_qpel_64x64`, `enc_ip_qpel4mv_64x64` — commands + SHA-256
    in `tests/fixtures/NOTES.md`) pin that the reference decoder's
    decode of our streams is **bit-exact** against this crate's own.

### Fixed

- **Cross-platform byte determinism of the transform pair** — the
  forward DCT and the Annex A.1 IDCT now evaluate against
  compile-time `f64` cosine literals (the nearest-`f64` to the
  mathematical values) instead of runtime `f64::cos`: libm
  implementations differ by an ulp across platforms, which round 438
  caught as a one-bit encoder-output drift on the other CI hosts
  (the method-1 fixture-determinism pin). With literal kernels every
  arithmetic step is IEEE-754-determined, so decode conformance and
  encoder emission are byte-identical on every platform.

### Added

- **Encoder robustness sweep (round 438, stage 7)** —
  `tests/encoder_stress.rs`: adversarial content (full-range LCG
  noise, 1×1 0/255 checkerboards, saturated flats, hard vertical
  edges) across qp {1, 13, 31}, both quantisation methods, partial-
  edge and single-macroblock grids, in I/P/I/P GOPs — every stream
  self-decodes sample-exact against the closed-loop reconstructions.


- **P-VOP encoder end-to-end (round 438, stage 6)** — `pvop_encode`:
  §7.6 motion estimation (±8-pel full-search SAD with §7.6.4
  edge-clamped fetches + §7.6.2.1 half-sample refinement through the
  decoder's own interpolator, zero-vector bias), intra/inter/skip
  mode decision, and the §6.2.6 P-VOP emission — `not_coded` skips,
  Table B.7 `mcbpc`, inter `cbpy`, Table B.12 `motion_vector()`
  against the §7.6.5 median predictor over the decoder-mirrored
  `MvGrid` state, Table B.17 inter residual EVENTs, and intra
  macroblocks through the shared I-VOP plan/emission path. The
  registry encoder now emits I+P streams under a `gop-size` option
  (default 12; 1 = intra-only) with per-packet keyframe flags, still
  closing the loop by decoding every emitted unit
  (`reconstruct_own_p_vop` drives the §7.6.1 anchor chain).
  Validation: I+5P self-decode **sample-exact** against the encoder
  reconstructions with real motion in play (`tests/encoder_p_vop.rs`;
  P units all smaller than the I unit, static scenes collapse to
  all-skip 15-byte P-VOPs, luma PSNR > 32 dB at qp 4, byte
  determinism incl. method-1), and a new black-box pair
  (`enc_ip_m2_64x64`): the reference decoder's decode of our I+P
  stream is **bit-exact** against this crate's own.

- **Registry-facing encoder (round 438, stage 5)** —
  `encoder::Mpeg4VideoEncoder` implements the
  `oxideav_core::Encoder` contract over the I-VOP encoder
  (send_frame → per-frame keyframe packets in the VOL tick time
  base, §6.3.5 modulo/increment clock from the caller's frame rate,
  configuration run in `output_params().extradata` and prepended to
  the first packet), with the `Mpeg4EncoderOptions` schema (`qp`,
  `mpeg-quant`, `ac-pred`) and the direct `make_encoder` factory —
  the dual-API sibling of `make_decoder`. `register()` now declares
  `encode` capability and the encoder factory + options schema.

- **Black-box cross-check of the encoder (round 438, stage 4)** —
  `tests/encoder_blackbox.rs` + the `enc_intra_m2_64x64` /
  `enc_intra_m1_64x64` fixture pairs: streams produced by this
  crate's own I-VOP encoder from a deterministic synthetic source,
  reference-decoded by the opaque black-box binary with the
  floating-point IDCT (commands + SHA-256 in
  `tests/fixtures/NOTES.md`). Pinned: byte-determinism of
  re-encoding, and decode agreement — the method-2 stream is
  **bit-exact** between this decoder and the reference decoder; the
  method-1 stream exercises the documented §7.4.4.5
  intra-mismatch divergence exactly as the compat contract predicts
  (ecosystem-compat decode bit-exact, literal-spec decode 834
  samples off by at most ±1).

- **I-VOP encoder end-to-end (round 438, stage 3)** — `ivop_encode`:
  §6.2 configuration-header emission (VisualObjectSequence with the
  Table G.1 profile — SP/L3 for method-2, ASP/L3 for method-1 —
  VisualObject, VideoObject, and a minimal-literal rectangular VOL),
  the §6.2.5 I-VOP header, and the full §6.2.6/§6.2.7 intra
  macroblock walk: forward DCT → quantisation → §7.4.3 DC/AC
  prediction *emission* (same `IntraBlockGrid` neighbour resolution
  as the decoder, incremental per-block recording, differentials
  instead of adds) → §7.4.2 forward scan (derived from the decoder's
  `inverse_scan`, drift-proof) → Tcoef VLC emission. The
  `ac_pred_flag` is decided per macroblock by measured cost (both
  variants emitted to probe writers). Every emitted VOP is decoded
  back through the crate's own `decode_i_vop_macroblocks` — the
  closed loop that makes the returned reconstruction the decoder's
  by construction. Validation (`tests/encoder_i_vop.rs`): multi-VOP
  streams under both quantisation methods and partial-edge
  macroblock grids decode through `Mpeg4VideoDecoder`
  **sample-exact** against the encoder reconstruction; PSNR floors
  at qp 4–6; byte determinism; a qp 2/8/31 sweep with monotone
  rate and distortion; and cost-decided AC prediction never grows
  the stream.

- **Encoder VLC emission (round 438, stage 2)** — `vlc_encode`, the
  exact inverses of the crate's transcribed decode tables:
  `put_intra_dc` (Table B.13/B.14 `dct_dc_size` + Table B.15
  additional code + NOTE-2 marker), `put_ac_event` /
  `put_ac_events` (Table B.16/B.17 Tcoef with §7.4.1.3 escape
  selection — direct codeword, Type 1 LMAX, Type 2 RMAX, Type 3
  fixed-length), `put_mcbpc_i` / `put_mcbpc_p` (Tables B.6/B.7),
  `put_cbpy` (Table B.8), `put_dquant` (Table 6-32), and
  `put_motion_vector` / `put_mv_component` / `wrap_mvd_component`
  (Table B.12 `mv_data` + §7.6.3 residuals and range wrap).
  Round-trip pinned against the decoder's own `decode_intra_dc` /
  `decode_ac_event` / `decode_mcbpc` / `decode_cbpy4` /
  `decode_motion_vector_delta` across the full domains (every
  tabulated EVENT both signs, escape sweeps, all `fcode` 1..=7).

- **Encoder groundwork (round 438, stage 1)** — the first pieces of
  the encoder arc: `bitwriter::BitWriter` (MSB-first `uimsbf`/`bslbf`
  emission with the §5.2.4 `next_start_code()` stuffing discipline),
  `fdct::forward_dct_8x8` (the Annex A.1 orthonormal forward
  transform in `f64`, rounded per §4.1 and saturated to the §7.4.4.4
  coefficient range — the exact dual of the crate's ideal IDCT), and
  `quantise` (forward quantisers inverting the §7.4.4 decoder
  formulas: intra DC via Table 7-1 `dc_scaler`, method-2
  intra/inter dead-zone quantisers, method-1 intra/inter against the
  `W` matrices, all levels clamped inside the escape-codable
  `[-2047, 2047]` domain). Each is pinned by round-trip tests
  against the crate's own decoder-side inverse pipeline.

### Fixed

- **Interlaced-direct macroblocks in a quarter-sample VOL now
  compensate through the §7.6.2.2 field cascade** —
  `interlaced_direct_prediction` /
  `BVopInterlacedDirectMbDecode::reconstruct` take a
  `FieldSampleMode` and route the derived quarter-pel field MVs
  through the quarter-sample field interpolator (the printed
  §7.7.2.2 pseudo code's `mc` call is half-sample only, but the
  §7.7.2.1 blanket rule — "In quarter_sample mode the macroblock is
  calculated as described in subclause 7.6.2.2, accordingly" —
  applies; unlike *progressive* direct mode the interlaced-direct
  vectors stay on the VOL grid). Validated by a new
  `ildct+ilme+qpel+bf 2` conformance stream
  (`ilaced_qpel_ipb_64x64`): spec mode carries only the documented
  §7.7.2.2 interlaced-direct co-located envelope (582/73728 ≈
  0.79 %, max 49) and under the ecosystem-compat zero-co-located
  derivation the stream is **fully bit-exact** — the corpus' first
  stream exercising the interlaced-direct clause with a 0-sample
  compat decode.
- **§7.7.2.1 quarter-sample field motion compensation is now
  bit-exact** — the interlaced+qpel conformance stream
  (`ilaced_qpel_ip_64x64`) drops its 1184-sample (max 111) bounded
  envelope and asserts `assert_stream_exact` in both behaviour modes.
  Two geometry facts the printed spec text leaves open were
  arbitrated by black-box pixel comparison over constructed
  single-macroblock field-prediction probe streams
  (`tests/field_qpel_probes.rs` + `tests/fixtures/fq_probe_*.yuv`):
  - each 16-wide luma field block interpolates as **two 8×8
    §7.6.2.2 blocks**, each with its own Figure 7-30 `(M+1)×(N+1)`
    read + boundary mirroring (a single 16-wide interpolation
    mispredicts isolated samples in the columns whose FIR taps span
    the centre seam; the progressive 16×16 1-MV macroblock keeps its
    single-block interpolation, pinned by the bit-exact progressive
    qpel streams);
  - the chroma field MV's **vertical** quarter → half halving floors
    on the field grid — new helper
    `field_motion::field_chroma_dy_qpel` (`2 * Div2Round(mv_y >> 2)`)
    replaces the truncating
    `field_chroma_dy(half_pel_chroma_mv_from_qpel(..))` composition,
    which mispredicted every probe with a negative odd field-grid
    component; the horizontal component keeps the truncating
    §7.6.5-style derivation (probe-confirmed for both signs).

### Added

- **Triple-axis conformance stream** `mq_ilaced_qpel_ipb_64x64`
  (method-1 quantisation + interlaced field DCT/ME + quarter-sample +
  B-VOPs): the spec default carries the combined intra-mismatch +
  interlaced-direct envelope (3858/73728 ≈ 5.2 %, max 54); under
  ecosystem-compat the stream collapses to the 4 IDCT near-ties —
  the method-1 intra exemption, the zero-co-located interlaced-direct
  derivation, and the arbitrated field-qpel geometry compose to a
  near-tie-exact decode.
- **§7.6.9.6 averaged-MV substitution for skipped co-located S(GMC)
  macroblocks** — `SGmcMbContent::Gmc` now retains the macroblock's
  §7.8.7.3 averaged motion vector and skip status; the decoder's
  anchor-motion extraction surfaces a *skipped* GMC macroblock as a
  non-skipped 1-MV macroblock carrying the AMV (per §7.6.9.6: "treated
  as a non-skipped macroblock with the averaged motion vector"), so a
  direct-mode B macroblock over it scales the AMV instead of taking
  the skipped-co-located forward-zero path. Coded GMC and intra
  macroblocks keep the §7.6.9.5.1 zero-vector fallback.
- **§E.1.4.4 RVLC recovery now reaches pixels** — the data-partitioned
  P-VOP walk (`decode_p_vop_macroblocks_dp`) catches a
  texture-partition error on a `reversible_vlc == 1` VOL and, instead
  of aborting, locates the packet's DCT-region end
  (`rvlc_recovery::texture_region_end` — next byte-aligned
  `resync_marker`, stuffing stripped), runs
  `recover_video_packet_dct` + `RvlcRecovery::stitch`, reconstructs
  every kept inter macroblock from its recovered EVENT runs
  (`rvlc_recovery::recovered_inter_macroblock` over the new shared
  §7.4 inter-block tail `block::inter_block_from_events`), conceals
  discarded and §E.1.4.4.2.2-INTRA macroblocks (trusted partition-1
  motion + zero residual; skipped-style zero-MV copy for concealed
  intras; whole-packet concealment when both decode directions fail),
  and repositions the reader so the walk resumes bit-exactly at the
  next video packet. `tests/rvlc_recovery_frame.rs` drives a
  hand-written two-packet RVLC stream with a truncated texture
  partition end-to-end: the recovery keeps front/back spans, conceals
  the errored middle, and leaves packet 2 bit-identical to the clean
  decode. (`BitReader` gains a `data()` accessor; `PVopMbContent` now
  derives `PartialEq`.)
- **Interlaced-direct probe pins** (`tests/direct_mode_probes.rs` +
  `tests/fixtures/dm_probe_*.yuv`): constructed P+B probe streams
  with provably non-zero co-located field MVs over textured anchors
  arbitrate the §7.7.2.2 ecosystem derivation directly — the compat
  zero-co-located model is **confirmed unconditionally** for a
  transmitted non-zero `MVD[0]` and for the zero-bit `modb "1"` form
  (compat decodes bit-exact up to near-ties), while a *transmitted*
  `MVD[0] == (0, 0)` observes **progressive** direct mode over the
  co-located frame vector `Div2Round(MVf1 + MVf2)` — a newly
  characterised sub-behaviour reproduced by neither mode (no
  conformance-corpus stream contains such a macroblock; the compat
  decision is deferred to a project ruling and both modes' envelopes
  are pinned).

- **Opt-in ecosystem-compat decode mode** (`compat::DecodeOptions`;
  default is the literal spec text) covering the two documented
  spec-vs-ecosystem divergences: the §7.7.2.2 interlaced-direct
  derivation with the co-located field MVs read as zero
  (`mvf[i] = mvb[i] = MVD[0]` on the field grid;
  `BVopMvDriver::with_zero_colocated_direct`), and the §7.4.4.5
  method-1 mismatch toggle skipped on intra blocks
  (`inverse_quant_method1_no_mismatch`,
  `MacroblockTextureContext::intra_mismatch_exempt`). Wired through
  every decode surface: the `vop_decode` macroblock walks take a
  `DecodeOptions` argument, `Mpeg4VideoDecoder::with_options` selects
  it on the elementary-stream decoder, and the registry path parses
  the `ecosystem-compat` bool from `CodecParameters::options`
  (`Mpeg4DecoderOptions`, declared via `decoder_options` on the
  registry entry; preserved across `Decoder::reset`).
- **Compat-mode conformance pins** (`compat_*` tests): the
  `mpeg_quant` I/P/B stream collapses from its 3062-sample spec-mode
  envelope to 4 near-tie samples, the interlaced I/P/B stream from
  650 samples (max 58) to 7 near-ties, and the 176×144
  interlaced-direct stream from 6202 samples (max 114) to 2777
  (0.29 %, max 64) with 29/30 interlaced-direct macroblocks
  bit-exact — the single residual macroblock's oracle reconstruction
  is uniquely determined by exhaustive per-field search and traced to
  a co-located anchor field-MV state that differs from the
  bitstream-reconstructed one (not pixel-determinable; docs trace
  ask filed). Streams exercising neither divergence are asserted
  sample-identical across both modes.

### Changed

- The internal decode plumbing (the `vop_decode` bitstream walks and the
  macroblock / texture / motion-vector / predictor machinery) is now
  `#[doc(hidden)]`; the documented API is the decoder surface
  (`Mpeg4VideoDecoder`, `Mpeg4PacketDecoder`, `make_decoder`,
  `Mpeg4DecoderOptions`, `compat::DecodeOptions`, `register`) plus the
  frame / parse-error types it exposes.

- The `vop_decode` walk entry points
  (`decode_{i,p,s_gmc}_vop_macroblocks`, the `_dp` variants,
  `decode_b_vop_macroblocks`, `decode_b_vop_interlaced_macroblocks`)
  take a trailing `compat::DecodeOptions` parameter
  (`DecodeOptions::spec()` reproduces the previous behaviour
  exactly).

- **§6.2.5.3 data-partitioned I-/P-VOP decode** wired into the frame
  loop: `decode_i_vop_macroblocks_dp` / `decode_p_vop_macroblocks_dp`
  walk the per-packet partition structure (partition 1 → 19-bit
  `dc_marker` / 17-bit `motion_marker` → partition 2 → texture
  partition) with §E.1.2 prediction resets, thread the §7.6.5
  predictor grid through partition 1 (`DpMbEvent` closure), decode the
  texture partition against the header-partition intra DC, and select
  the Table B.23 reversible VLC when `reversible_vlc == 1`. B-VOPs
  keep the combined syntax (§6.2.5.3 NOTE). Black-box validated
  (data-partitioned I/P/B conformance fixture inside the twin-IDCT
  envelope).
- **Interlaced direct-mode B-frame conformance fixture** (176×144, 30
  interlaced-direct MBs): classification matches the fixture's
  independent per-VOP distribution 30/30.
- **Bit-exact conformance corpus** (`tests/conformance.rs` +
  `tests/fixtures/NOTES.md` with generation commands and SHA-256):
  every reference decode regenerated with the oracle's floating-point
  (ideal Annex A.1) IDCT, and the assertions tightened from the old
  ±2/±3 "twin-IDCT envelope" to **bit-exact** on eleven streams
  (intra / I+P / I+P+B / qpel-IP / qpel-IPB / qpel+4MV / AC-prediction
  / progressive alternate-scan / data-partitioned / QCIF-resync /
  interlaced-IP2), near-exact (a budget of ±1 near-tie IDCT samples,
  root-caused to the oracle's single-precision transform) on four
  more, and bounded with documented root causes on the remaining
  three (method-1 intra mismatch control; §7.7.2.2 interlaced direct
  — oracle substitutes zero co-located MVs, solved by exhaustive
  per-macroblock-field search; interlaced quarter-sample field
  interpolation — oracle's field FIR cascade differs, no vector
  candidate reproduces it). Six new fixtures widen the tool axes:
  `mpeg_quant` I/P/B, progressive alternate scan, AC prediction,
  quarter-sample + 4-MV, 176×144 I/P/B with ~120-byte video packets,
  and interlaced quarter-sample I+P.

### Fixed

- **§4.1 `//` operator in the §7.4.3 DC / AC predictors**: the spec's
  `//` is integer division with rounding to the *nearest* integer
  (half-integer values away from zero), not truncation. The §7.4.3.2
  DC reconstruction (`F[0][0] // dc_scaler`) and both §7.4.3.3 AC
  quantiser rescales (`(QF · Qp) // QpX`) previously truncated,
  biasing every predicted intra DC/AC low by up to one quantised step
  (chroma planes of the reference streams showed a uniform +1..+2
  pixel offset). With the fix, the intra-only / I+P / I+P+B / qpel-IP
  / data-partitioned conformance streams decode **bit-exactly**
  against a floating-point-IDCT reference decode.
- **§7.6.9.2/.3/.4 B-VOP forward / backward / interpolated MC block
  size**: these modes carry one MV per direction for the whole
  macroblock and compensate a single 16×16 luminance block. The walk
  compensated four 8×8 sub-blocks instead — equivalent on the
  half-sample grid, but *not* in quarter-sample mode, where the
  §7.6.2.2 block-boundary mirroring differs at the interior sub-block
  seams (the §7.6.9.5.3 NOTE spells the distinction out). Interpolated
  quarter-pel B macroblocks could deviate by up to ±3 near seams.
- **§7.6.9.5.2 direct mode in quarter-sample VOLs derives on the
  quarter grid** (and compensates through §7.6.2.2): the co-located MV
  and `MVD[0]` (decoded with `f_code == 1` like every vector of the
  VOP) already share the quarter-pel grid, so the derivation formulas
  apply without unit conversion — the fourth paragraph's Table 7-13
  halving covers a hypothetical half-pel-delta mismatch that does not
  arise. The 8×8 compensation runs through the §7.6.2.2 quarter-sample
  interpolation (FIR half-sample values + Figure 7-30 block-boundary
  mirroring) instead of the §7.6.2.1 bilinear process, which §7.6.2
  restricts to `quarter_sample == 0`; the §7.6.9.5.3 chroma reduction
  applies the quarter-mode per-vector `/ 2` pre-halving. Solved from
  pixels by exhaustive per-sub-block search: co-located
  `MV[0] = (1, 1)`, `MVD = (0, 3)`, `TRB/TRD = 1/3` reconstructs at
  `MVF = (0, 3)` / `MVB = (0, 2)` — the unconverted quarter-grid
  evaluation. Quarter-sample I/P/B streams (including direct mode over
  4-MV anchors) now decode bit-exactly against the
  floating-point-IDCT reference decode.
- **§7.4.2 scan selection was transposed**: DC prediction from the
  horizontally adjacent block (A) selects the *alternate-vertical*
  scan and prediction from the vertically adjacent block (C) the
  *alternate-horizontal* scan — the scan runs perpendicular to the
  prediction edge. The mapping was swapped, garbling every AC
  coefficient of every `ac_pred_flag == 1` intra block; an
  AC-prediction stream now decodes bit-exactly.
- **§7.6.5 quarter-sample chroma reduction**: "the vectors are divided
  by 2 before summation" is the §4.1 truncating integer halving per
  vector, landing the sum on the same sixteenth/twelfth/eighth/fourth
  grids as half-sample mode (the only resolutions §7.6.5 names — an
  algebraic halving would need thirty-second/twenty-fourth tables that
  do not exist). The previous fold of the doubled grid onto the Table
  7-11/7-10 entries missed 4-MV quarter-sample P-VOP chrominance by
  tens of grey levels; now bit-exact.

- **§7.7.2.2 interlaced-direct vertical derivation runs on the field
  grid**: §7.7.2 fixes the invariant that field motion vectors are
  vertically even in half-pel frame coordinates (one field line = two
  frame lines; §7.7.2.1 recovers coded field MVs as
  `MVy = 2*(MVDy + Py/2)`). The four derived direct-mode field vectors
  must satisfy the same invariant, so the `(TRB*MV)/TRD + MVD[0]`
  vertical arithmetic operates on field-grid values (co-located
  `MV[i].y` halved exactly from its even frame form, the result doubled
  back for the `mc` call) — a frame-coordinate evaluation would emit
  odd verticals whose low bit the §7.6.9.1 field `mc` silently masks.
  Black-box-confirmed: the reference decode displaces a direct
  macroblock with `MVD[0].y == -21` by exactly 21 frame lines in both
  derived fields (solved pixel-exactly by exhaustive search over the
  field-MC candidate space).

- **§7.6.5 intra neighbour candidates**: an intra macroblock
  contributes a *valid zero* motion-vector candidate to the median
  predictor (the four validity rules only invalidate transparent /
  outside-packet neighbours). Previously recorded as invalid,
  mis-predicting inter MBs bordering intra MBs next to motion.
- **Table 7-15 unified four-PMV bank**: frame- and field-predicted
  interlaced-B macroblocks now share one predictor bank (frame forward
  uses PMV[0], updates PMV[0,1]; backward PMV[2] → PMV[2,3]);
  previously two independent banks never saw each other's updates.
- **§7.7.2.2 field backward reconstruction**: the printed
  `PMV[3].x = PMV[1].x + MVD[1].x` (a forward slot) is corrected to
  the same-slot `PMV[3].x`, matching Table 7-15 and the sibling
  forward listing.
- **§7.7.2.2 interlaced-direct backward MC (erratum E1)**: `mvb[0]`
  drives the top field, `mvb[1]` the bottom (printed code passes
  `mvb[1]` in all four slots).
- **Direct-mode delta with `vop_fcode > 1`**: the §7.6.9.5.2 /
  §7.7.2.2 delta is decoded assuming `f_code == 1` — unit
  reconstruction scale, not just "no residual bits"; previously the
  reconstruction still scaled by `f`.

- **Quarter-sample decode path end-to-end** (§7.6.2.2): the P-, S(GMC)-
  and B-VOP walks accept `quarter_sample == 1` VOLs. The sub-pel
  cascade now runs on the Figure 7-30 mirrored `(M+1)×(N+1)` reference
  block (three-sample symmetric extension per block — four 8×8
  interpolations no longer equal one 16×16, per the §7.6.9.5.3 NOTE);
  the §7.6.5 chroma reduction gains the quarter-sample derivation
  (`chroma_mv_from_luma_blocks_qpel`: the divide-by-2-before-summation
  is algebraic — K=1 on the eighth-sample grid / Table 7-12, K=2 on
  the sixteenth / Table 7-10 — validated sample-exact against a
  black-box reference decode); §7.6.9.5 direct mode converts the
  quarter-pel co-located MV to half-pel (Table 7-13) per the
  §7.6.9.5.2 fourth paragraph and reconstructs on the half-pel grid
  (`BVopMbDecode::luma_sample_mode`).
- **Per-sub-block direct-mode co-located MVs** (§7.6.9.5.2 `MV[i]`):
  `CoLocatedAnchor` carries the four co-located block vectors, so a
  4-MV (inter4v) anchor macroblock yields four distinct
  `(MVF[i], MVB[i])` pairs and the true §7.6.9.5.3 K=4 chroma
  reduction.
- **§7.6.6 overlapped motion compensation** wired into the P path:
  `assemble_p_vop_frame_obmc` blends each 8×8 luminance block's three
  fetches through the Figure 7-35/7-36/7-37 weights, gathering remote
  vectors from the frame-wide block motion field with the four
  substitution rules; skipped macroblocks overlap with the zero
  vector; chrominance stays on the §7.6.5 path. The decoder dispatches
  on `obmc_disable == 0`.
- **Presentation timestamps**: `DecodedFrame::pts` (container packet
  pts, attached in display order via
  `Mpeg4VideoDecoder::decode_with_pts` — anchors stamped on the held
  §6.1.3.8 pending frame so stamps survive the reorder) and
  `DecodedFrame::pts_ticks` (the §6.3.5 composed VOP time in
  `1 / vop_time_increment_resolution` ticks). `Mpeg4PacketDecoder`
  emits `VideoFrame::pts` from the packet stamp with the tick
  fallback.
- **Interlaced decode** (`interlaced == 1`): the I- and P-VOP walks
  decode interlaced VOLs — §6.2.6.3 `dct_type` routes macroblocks
  through the §7.7.1 inverse field-DCT line permutation (intra
  texture and inter residuals), the §6.3.5
  `alternate_vertical_scan_flag` (now surfaced on `VopHeader` with
  `top_field_first`) selects the Figure 7-4 (b) scan for the whole
  VOP, and §7.7.2.1 field-predicted macroblocks decode their two
  field MV pairs against the CASE 1/2/3 shared predictor
  (`MvDriver::decode_field_macroblock`) and reconstruct via
  `field_motion_compensate_one_reference`
  (`PVopMbContent::FieldInter`). Interlaced B-VOPs decode through
  `decode_b_vop_interlaced_macroblocks`: §7.7.2.2 field forward /
  backward / bidirectional (Table 7-14/7-15 four-PMV bank),
  interlaced direct mode from the co-located future macroblock's
  forward field MV pairs (`AnchorMbMotion` keeps the field shape),
  video-packet resync, and field-DCT B residuals.

### Fixed

- **§7.7.2.1 field-chroma vertical component**: the field-mode `mc()`
  encodes the same-field half-sample flag on bit 1, so the 4:2:0
  chroma vertical MV is `2 * Div2Round(MVy / 2)` — the naive
  `Div2Round(MVy)` composition of the two pseudo-code fragments
  silently dropped the `MVy ≡ +2 (mod 8)` interpolation while keeping
  the negative mirrors (black-box-validated sample-exact).

### Known gaps

- §7.7.2.2 **interlaced direct mode**: the spec's pseudo code is
  internally inconsistent (the backward call passes `mvb[1]` for both
  fields and tests a nonexistent `MVD[i]`), and the black-box
  reference decode disagrees with the literal forward TRB/TRD scaling
  on isolated macroblocks. The crate implements the spec text
  literally; `tests/conformance.rs` bounds the deviation until a
  clean-room erratum/trace resolves the intended derivation.

- **Runtime codec registration + dual-API factory** (`decoder`):
  `register()` installs a real decoder entry (`CodecInfo` id
  `mpeg4video`, implementation `mpeg4video_sw`) claiming the
  XVID / DIVX / DX50 / FMP4 / MP4V / M4S2 FourCCs and MP4
  ObjectTypeIndication `0x20`. `Mpeg4PacketDecoder` adapts the
  elementary-stream decoder to the framework send-packet /
  receive-frame contract (display-order planar 4:2:0 `VideoFrame`s,
  extradata priming, `reset()` re-priming after seeks, and the
  `DecoderLimits::max_pixels_per_frame` DoS cap);
  `decoder::make_decoder` is the direct factory endpoint.
- **Top-level elementary-stream decoder** (`decoder::Mpeg4VideoDecoder`):
  start-code scan (§6.2.1) → §6.2 configuration parsers → §6.2.4 GOV
  time-code sync → §6.2.5 VOP headers → the per-coding-type macroblock
  walks → `SequenceDecoder` display-order output. Implements the §6.3.5
  time model (anchor `modulo_time_base` accumulation; B-VOPs count from
  the previous display-order anchor) from which the §7.6.7 `TRB`/`TRD`
  fall out as tick differences, retains the future anchor's per-MB
  motion as the §7.6.9.5.1 co-located source, and reconstructs
  `vop_coded == 0` VOPs as forward-reference copies.
- **Bitstream-driven macroblock walks** (`vop_decode`): raster loops
  that decode a whole rectangular progressive VOP straight off the
  bitstream — I-VOP (per-block Figure 7-5 predictor resolution against
  a running `IntraBlockGrid`, Table 6-25 `use_intra_dc_vlc` from the
  running quantiser), P-VOP (`MvDriver` motion + §7.4 residuals + intra
  MBs), S(GMC)-VOP (`mcsel` routing, §7.8.7.3 averaged-MV predictor
  recording, warp geometry from the VOP trajectory), and B-VOP
  (`BVopMvDriver` + §6.2.6 `co_located_not_coded` zero-bit macroblocks).
- **§6.2.5.2 video-packet resync handling** in all four walks:
  non-destructive stuffing+marker probe, `video_packet_header` decode,
  and the §E.1.2 "treated like a VOP boundary" state reset (fresh
  §7.4.3 / §7.6.5 predictor grids, quantiser restart from
  `quant_scale`, re-stated `intra_dc_vlc_thr`); B-VOP packets may
  resume ahead of the raster index across runs of zero-bit macroblocks.
- **Real-stream conformance** (`tests/conformance.rs`): three
  reference-encoder-produced 64×64 fixtures (intra-only with video
  packets, I+4P, I/P/B with two consecutive B-VOPs) decode end-to-end
  and match the reference decode within the twin-IDCT envelope (max ±2
  per sample, no drift growth across the GOP).
- **Traced intra-block decode** (`decode_intra_block_full`): returns
  the §7.4.3 predictor by-products (post-prediction saturated `QF`
  rows/columns + inverse-quantised `F[0][0]`) and implements the Table
  6-25 `use_intra_dc_vlc == 0` path (differential DC carried by the AC
  EVENT stream at scan position 0). `parse_vop_header_body` exposes the
  reader-based §6.2.5 header parse the walks consume.

### Fixed

- **§7.6.5 chroma-MV derivation** (`chroma_mv`): the reduction
  decomposed `sum/(2K)` against the half-sample floor and re-added the
  table offset, double-counting the half step for odd residues (luma
  `MVx = 3` → chroma `2` instead of `1`). The whole-pel part is
  `sum div 4K` (two half-samples each) and Table 7-10/11/12/13 is
  indexed directly by `sum mod 4K`.
- **§6.3.3 B-VOP `resync_marker` length** (`video_packet`): the
  `max(15 + fcode, 17)` applies to the **zero count**, so the shortest
  B marker is 17 zeros + 1 = 18 bits; the old formula floored the total
  bit count at 17 and mis-probed every B-VOP packet.
- **§6.2.6 `co_located_not_coded`** (`vop_decode`): a B macroblock
  whose co-located future-P macroblock was skipped transmits no bits at
  all (the whole `modb` subtree is gated out) and reconstructs per
  §7.6.9.6 as a forward zero-MV copy; the walk previously parsed a
  `modb` and desynced.

- **§7.6.1 decoded-picture buffer / reference-frame chain** (`framestore`):
  `DecodedFrame` owns the three 4:2:0 sample planes of one decoded VOP as
  flat `Vec<u8>` buffers, blits each reconstructed macroblock into place
  (`blit_macroblock`), and hands out `ReferenceVop` plane views
  (`luma_reference` / `cb_reference` / `cr_reference`) for the next VOP's
  motion compensation. `FrameStore` threads the §7.6.1 / §7.5.2.1.2
  forward (past) + backward (future) anchor chain: `push_anchor` advances
  the chain for an I-/P-/S(GMC)-VOP (B-VOPs never enter the chain),
  `p_vop_reference` selects the single P-/S-VOP reference, and
  `b_vop_references` / `b_vop_reference_views` select the bracketing
  forward+backward anchor pair (and its six `ReferenceVop` views) for a
  B-VOP per the line-17446..17467 reference-VOP rules.
- **P-VOP / I-VOP frame-assembly drivers** (`frame_decode`):
  `assemble_p_vop_frame` reconstructs a complete P-VOP from per-macroblock
  content (`PVopMbContent::Inter { motion, residual }` or
  `PVopMbContent::Intra`) against the §7.5.2.1.2 forward reference plane
  pulled from the `FrameStore`, blitting each `ReconstructedMacroblock`
  into a fresh `DecodedFrame`; `decode_p_vop` / `decode_i_vop` assemble
  and advance the reference-frame chain in one call. `InterMacroblock::zero`
  constructs the empty-`cbp` residual.
- **Progressive B-VOP frame-assembly driver** (`assemble_b_vop_frame`):
  reconstructs a complete progressive B-VOP from per-macroblock
  `BVopMbTexturedDecode`s against the bracketing forward+backward anchors
  pulled from the `FrameStore` (§7.6.1; a B-VOP is never pushed into the
  chain), building the six §7.6.9.5.1 `BVopAnchorPlanes` views and routing
  each macroblock through `BVopMbDecode::reconstruct`. Tests verify
  forward-only copies the past anchor, backward-only the future anchor,
  and bidirectional the §7.6.9.4 `(fwd + bwd + 1) >> 1` average.
- **S(GMC)-VOP frame-assembly driver** (`assemble_s_gmc_vop_frame`):
  reconstructs a complete S(GMC)-VOP from per-macroblock `SGmcMbContent`
  (`Gmc` / `Local` / `Intra`) against the §7.5.2.1.2 forward anchor pulled
  from the `FrameStore`. `mcsel == 1` macroblocks warp the reference plane
  via the supplied `WarpGeometry` (§7.8.7.1 GMC branch); `mcsel == 0`
  macroblocks take the §7.6.2 local-MC P-VOP path; intra macroblocks blit
  as-is. The S(GMC)-VOP is an anchor (the caller pushes it into the chain).
- **§6.1.3.8 VOP reordering / coding→display sequence driver**
  (`sequence::SequenceDecoder`): consumes coded VOPs in bitstream
  (decoding) order via `push_i_vop` / `push_p_vop` / `push_s_gmc_vop` /
  `push_b_vop` and emits frames in **display order**, applying the
  §6.1.3.8 one-slot anchor reorder delay (an I/P/S-VOP holds back one
  slot; B-VOPs display immediately between their bracketing anchors;
  `flush` releases the final anchor). Owns the `FrameStore` reference
  chain internally. A test reproduces the §6.1.3.8 worked example —
  coded `1I 4P 2B 3B` → displayed `1I 2B 3B 4P`.
- **§7.8.3.1 / §7.8.3.2 sprite-object-buffer hole handling**
  (`SpriteObjectBuffer`): tracks the per-macroblock `send_mb()` occupancy
  of the sprite-object grid (`object_piece_new_macroblocks` returns the
  new MBs an object-piece carries a body for, skipping holes already sent
  by an earlier piece) and validates update-pieces
  (`update_piece_refined_macroblocks` — every refined MB's object MB must
  already exist, per the §7.8.3.2 ordering rule).
- **§7.8.5 perspective static-sprite chroma + per-MB warp**
  (`static_sprite_chroma_perspective`,
  `static_sprite_luma_macroblock_perspective`).
- **§6.2.5.4 low-latency static-sprite piece transmission** (`sprite_piece`):
  the `SpriteTransmitMode` (Table 6-26 stop/piece/update/pause),
  `decode_sprite_piece()` header (`piece_quant` / `piece_width` /
  `piece_height` / `piece_xoffset` / `piece_yoffset`), the
  `brightness_change_factor()` VLC (Table B.35, five magnitude bands),
  the §6.2.5 `do { sprite_transmit_mode; … } while` piece loop
  (`drive_sprite_piece_loop`), and the composed §6.2.5 static S-VOP
  sprite block (`parse_static_sprite_vop_block` — trajectory + brightness
  + piece loop).
- **§7.8.5 four-point perspective sprite warp** (`perspective_warp`):
  `PerspectiveWarp` derives the §7.8.5 perspective coefficients
  (`g`/`h`/`D`, `a..f`) from the four §7.8.4 sprite reference points and
  maps a VOP pixel to its `1/s`-pel luma `(F,G)` / chroma `(Fc,Gc)`
  reference coordinate in `i128` (per the §7.8.5 32-bit-overflow NOTE),
  reporting degenerate (zero-denominator) parameter sets. Wired into
  static-sprite reconstruction via `static_sprite_luma_perspective` and
  fed by `decode_sprite_trajectory_static` (up to 4 warping points).
- **§6.2.5.2 `motion_coding` helper for data-partitioned P-VOPs**
  (`decode_motion_coding`): consumes the `motion_coding("forward",
  type_of_mb)` MV-delta field group (one `motion_vector` body, or four
  for an Inter4V macroblock) via `decode_motion_vector_delta`, returning
  the raw forward deltas — a ready-made `decode_motion` closure body for
  `parse_data_partitioned_p_vop` so the P-VOP partition-1 motion no
  longer needs a hand-rolled closure. 2 tests: a full data-partitioned
  P-VOP packet driven through the helper (one inter MB, `(0,0)` delta),
  and an Inter4V reading exactly four deltas.
- **§E.1.4.4.2 kept-MB stitching + INTRA concealment** (`RvlcRecovery::stitch`):
  collapses a two-way recovery into the final per-macroblock decode set,
  applying the §E.1.4.4.2.1 keep decision (forward result for the first
  `keep_front` MBs, backward for the last `keep_back`, the errored middle
  discarded → `None`) *and* the §E.1.4.4.2.2 INTRA-MB concealment (every
  INTRA MB in an errored packet returns `None` even when the strategy
  would keep it). A `Clean` recovery returns every MB unconditionally. 2
  tests: clean pass-through, and a five-MB recovered case validating
  front/back keep, the discarded middle, and INTRA concealment of a kept
  index.
- **Data-partition → RVLC-recovery bridge** (`mb_block_layout`): derives
  the §E.1.4.4 texture-partition `MbBlockLayout` for one data-partitioned
  macroblock from its parsed partition-1 record + partition-2 texture
  header, mapping the §6.3.7 `cbpy` / `cbpc` coded-block pattern to the
  per-block Tcoef table (Table B.16 intra / B.17 inter) so the texture
  partition of a `data_partitioned` + `reversible_vlc` VOP can be fed
  straight into `recover_video_packet_dct`. An end-to-end test builds a
  two-intra-MB data-partitioned I-VOP packet (partition-1 mcbpc →
  dc_marker → partition-2 ac_pred/cbpy → reversible-VLC texture
  partition), parses it with `parse_data_partitioned_i_vop`, derives the
  layouts, and runs the RVLC recovery to recover each MB's EVENT —
  closing the data-partitioned bitstream → texture-decode loop. 2 tests
  (layout derivation across intra/inter/not-coded + the full pipeline).
- **§E.1.4.4 two-way RVLC error-recovery driver** (new `rvlc_recovery`
  module): assembles the previously-composable RVLC pieces — the forward
  EVENT decoder, the backward EVENT decoder, and the §E.1.4.4.2.1
  arbitration — into the actual recovery walk. `recover_video_packet_dct`
  forward-decodes a video packet's DCT-coefficient region
  macroblock-by-macroblock (per a caller-supplied `MbBlockLayout` giving
  each MB's coded blocks + Tcoef tables), tracking per-MB cumulative bit
  costs (L1 / N1). On a §E.1.4.4.1 forward error (illegal RVLC, bad
  escape, missing `LAST`, or a >64-coefficient block) it backward-decodes
  from the packet end — segmenting EVENTs into blocks on the `LAST` flag
  via a non-consuming peek (the `BackwardBitReader` is now `Clone`) —
  gathers L2 / N2, runs `RvlcArbitration::select`, and returns
  `RvlcRecovery::Recovered { arbitration, forward, backward }`. A clean
  forward decode returns `RvlcRecovery::Clean`; an unrecoverable tail
  propagates the backward error. This closes the README's
  "video-packet driver that detects the forward-decode error, runs both
  directions, gathers the L/N/L1/L2/N1/N2 inputs, and applies the kept-MB
  decision" gap. 5 tests: the (1,0,1) inter reversible codeword sanity
  check, a clean three-MB decode, a no-coded-blocks MB, a forward-error →
  two-way trigger, and a multi-EVENT block round-tripped forward and
  backward to validate the tail-first per-block segmentation.
- **§6.2.5.3 data-partitioned macroblock-layer parsing** (new
  `data_partition` module): parses the `data_partitioned_i_vop()` and
  `data_partitioned_p_vop()` rectangular bitstream layouts that the
  combined (non-partitioned) path never covered. `parse_data_partitioned_i_vop`
  walks partition 1 (`mcbpc` + `dquant` + intra-DC when `use_intra_dc_vlc`)
  to the 19-bit §6.3.5 `dc_marker` `110 1011 0000 0000 0001`, then
  partition 2 (`ac_pred_flag` + `cbpy`) for every macroblock, returning the
  bit offset of the partition-3 `block()` texture region.
  `parse_data_partitioned_p_vop` walks partition 1 (`not_coded` + `mcbpc`
  + §6.3.6 `mcsel` + caller-supplied `motion_coding()` closure) to the
  17-bit `motion_marker` `1 1111 0000 0000 0001`, then partition 2
  (`ac_pred_flag` + `cbpy` + `dquant` + intra-DC). New `use_intra_dc_vlc`
  helper transcribes the Table 6-25 `intra_dc_vlc_thr` → running-Qp
  threshold derivation. The `MacroblockHeader` primitives
  (`decode_mcbpc` / `decode_cbpy4` / the B.6/B.7 `mcbpc` tables) are now
  shared `pub(crate)` and `DerivedMbType::from_raw` maps the raw Table B.1
  integer. 7 tests covering marker bit-exactness, the Table 6-25
  derivation, exact `dc_marker` detection, an I-VOP two-intra-MB packet
  (byte-exact `texture_start_bit`), a missing-marker error, and a P-VOP
  packet mixing a skipped MB with a coded inter MB.
- **Unified interlaced B-VOP reconstruction**
  (`BVopInterlacedTexturedDecode::reconstruct`): closes the §7.6.9 /
  §7.7.2.2 → §7.3 reconstruction loop for an interlaced B-VOP macroblock.
  It dispatches on the path variant — the progressive path consumes the
  `BVopAnchorPlanes` + `BVopSampleMode`; the field-prediction and
  interlaced-direct paths consume the `BVopFieldReferences` +
  `FieldSampleMode` — routing to the matching per-variant `reconstruct`
  and adding the macroblock's residual with the §7.3 display clip, so the
  caller never has to `match` the variant. Paired with
  `decode_interlaced_vop` this is a complete decode→reconstruct path for a
  per-macroblock-supplied reference chain. 1 test: a field-forward 1×2 VOP
  reconstructed through the unified entry (copies the forward reference).
- **End-to-end interlaced B-VOP frame walker**
  (`BVopMvDriver::decode_interlaced_vop`): the interlaced analogue of the
  progressive `decode_vop`. It walks an interlaced B-VOP in raster order,
  dispatching each macroblock's motion through the unified
  `decode_interlaced_macroblock` (progressive / field-prediction /
  interlaced-direct), resetting both the progressive and §7.7.2.2 four-PMV
  predictors at each row start, applying each macroblock's `dbquant` to a
  running quantiser scale (§6.3.6), and threading the §7.4 inter residual
  decode gated by `cbpb` into the same loop. Returns one
  `BVopInterlacedTexturedDecode` (path-tagged motion + residual +
  quantiser scale) per macroblock. New `BVopInterlacedMb::cbpb()` /
  `dbquant_delta()` accessors expose the residual-gating fields uniformly
  across the three path variants. 1 test: a mixed-mode 1×2 VOP
  (field-forward MB + progressive-forward MB with a coded residual)
  confirming per-MB dispatch + residual threading + the §6.2.6.3
  `dct_type` + `field_prediction` body ordering.
- **Unified interlaced B-VOP macroblock dispatch**
  (`BVopMvDriver::decode_interlaced_macroblock`): a single entry that
  parses the §6.2.6 header once and routes to the progressive (§7.6.9),
  interlaced field-prediction (§7.7.2.2 forward / backward /
  bidirectional), or interlaced-direct (§7.7.2.2) decode based on the
  decoded `mb_type` + `field_prediction` — so an interlaced B-VOP frame
  loop no longer has to peek the header to pre-select which dedicated
  method to call. The new `BVopInterlacedAnchor` bundles the per-MB anchor
  state every path might need (the §7.6.9.5.1 / §7.6.9.6 progressive
  co-located anchor, the optional co-located *future* field MVs for
  interlaced direct, and `top_field_first`); the result is a tagged
  `BVopInterlacedMb` (`Progressive` / `Field` / `InterlacedDirect`)
  carrying the same per-MB decode each dedicated entry produces. Dispatch
  honours the §7.6.9.6 co-located-skipped override first, then routes a
  field-predicted non-direct MB to the field path, a Direct MB with
  future field MVs to interlaced direct, and everything else (including a
  progressive-direct MB with no future field MVs) to the progressive
  path. The three dedicated methods now share extracted post-header
  helpers (`field_from_header` / `interlaced_direct_from_header`) so the
  unified path and the dedicated paths decode identically. 6 tests: each
  routing case + the co-located-skipped override + out-of-bounds.
- **§7.7.2.2 interlaced-direct reference-frame-chain bridge**
  (`ColocatedFutureFieldMvs::from_field_motion`): builds the co-located
  future field MVs an interlaced-direct B-VOP macroblock consumes from a
  decoded interlaced P-VOP macroblock's reconstructed forward field motion
  vectors (`FieldMotionVectors`) and its `top_field_reference` /
  `bottom_field_reference` flags (§6.3.6.3). This closes the last
  interlaced-direct plumbing step: the future macroblock's two forward
  field MVs + reference fields feed straight into
  `decode_interlaced_direct_macroblock`. 1 test (constructor + end-to-end
  through the driver with a δ-shifted field-temporal derivation).
- **§7.7.2.2 interlaced-direct B-VOP frame-driver wiring**
  (`BVopMvDriver::decode_interlaced_direct_macroblock`): the frame driver
  now decodes an interlaced-direct B-VOP macroblock end-to-end instead of
  rejecting direct mode with `FieldPredictionUnsupported`. The method
  parses the §6.2.6 header (a `modb == "1"` default direct, or an explicit
  Direct `mb_type`), reads the single `MVD[0]` body (decoded with
  `f_code == 1` regardless of the VOP header f_codes, §7.7.2.2; implicitly
  zero for `modb == "1"`), and threads the caller-supplied co-located
  *future* P-VOP macroblock's two forward field MVs + their reference
  fields (`ColocatedFutureFieldMvs`) and the B-VOP's `top_field_first`
  flag through the round-267 `interlaced_direct_mvs` derivation, using the
  driver's frame-period `TRB` / `TRD`. Returns a
  `BVopInterlacedDirectMbDecode` carrying the four derived field MVs, the
  future macroblock's forward reference fields, and `cbpb` / `dbquant`.
  `BVopInterlacedDirectMbDecode::reconstruct` closes the §7.7.2.2 → §7.3
  bridge — it runs `interlaced_direct_prediction` (forward + backward
  field MC + `(fwd + bak + 1) >> 1` average) against the six reference
  planes and adds the §7.4 residual with the §7.3 display clip. The
  four-PMV bank is untouched (direct mode neither reads nor updates it).
  A non-direct macroblock is rejected with `FieldPredictionUnsupported`.
  This completes the interlaced-direct path inside the frame driver — the
  last remaining interlaced-direct step noted in round 267. 5 tests:
  `modb == "1"` zero-delta derivation, explicit `MVD[0]` application, the
  non-direct rejection, out-of-bounds rejection, and a zero-MV
  forward/backward-average pixel reconstruction.
- **§7.7.2.2 interlaced-direct B-VOP field motion-vector derivation**
  (new `bvop_field_direct` module): `interlaced_direct_mvs` derives the
  four field motion vectors `mvf[0..2]` (forward top/bottom) / `mvb[0..2]`
  (backward top/bottom) of an interlaced-direct B-VOP macroblock from the
  co-located future P-VOP macroblock's two forward field MVs `MV[i]`, the
  single transmitted differential `MVD[0]`, and the §7.7.2.2 field-period
  temporal references — `TRD[i] = 2*trd_frame + δ[i]`,
  `TRB[i] = 2*trb_frame + δ[i]`, with `δ[i]` the full Table 7-16 parity
  selection (`delta`, indexed by the future macroblock's per-field
  reference selections × `top_field_first`). The `mvf`/`mvb` formulas
  reproduce the spec's zero-delta scaled-backward form vs. the
  `mvf - MV` non-zero-delta form per component, with `/` truncating toward
  zero (§3.4). `interlaced_direct_prediction` assembles the prediction
  macroblock: the §7.7.2.2 forward field MC (`mvf[0]`/`mvf[1]`, co-located
  future refs) + backward field MC (`mvb[1]` for **both** output fields,
  refs fixed Top/Bottom per the spec's `0,1` literal), averaged
  `(fwd + bak + 1) >> 1`. 7 tests: all 8 Table 7-16 rows, the field-period
  conversion, the zero- and non-zero-delta backward forms, per-field δ
  shift, toward-zero truncation, and a zero-MV forward/backward-average
  reconstruction. (Frame-driver plumbing of the future-MB field MVs +
  frame-period TRB/TRD is the remaining interlaced-direct step.)
- **§7.7.2.2 interlaced field-prediction B-VOP frame-driver wiring**
  (`BVopMvDriver::decode_field_macroblock`): the frame driver now decodes
  a field-predicted B-VOP macroblock end-to-end instead of returning
  `FieldPredictionUnsupported` for the non-direct field modes. The driver
  carries a §7.7.2.2 four-PMV bank (`FieldPmvBank`) threaded alongside the
  progressive predictor and reset together at each row start
  (`start_row`). `decode_field_macroblock` parses the §6.2.6 header,
  confirms the macroblock is field-predicted (a populated forward /
  backward reference pair), decodes the §6.2.6 field motion bodies, and
  threads them through the bank (forward → slots 0,1; backward → 2,3;
  bidirectional → all four), returning a `BVopFieldMbDecode` (new
  `BVopFieldMode` enum + the four `*_field_reference` flags + `cbpb` /
  `dbquant` + a pre-update bank snapshot). `BVopFieldMbDecode::reconstruct`
  closes the §7.7.2.2 → §7.3 bridge — it re-runs the field MC against the
  six supplied reference planes and adds the §7.4 residual with the §7.3
  display clip. Interlaced **direct** mode and frame-predicted MBs are
  still routed away with `FieldPredictionUnsupported` (direct needs the
  field-period TRB/TRD + Table 7-16 δ). 5 tests: field-forward decode +
  pixel reconstruction (forward-anchor copy), field-bidirectional
  forward/backward average, field-PMV row reset, and the
  frame-predicted-MB rejection.
- **§7.7.2.2 interlaced B-VOP field motion-compensated reconstruction**
  (new `bvop_field_motion` module): the three non-direct field-prediction
  modes (field forward `mb_type == "0001"`, field backward `"001"`, field
  bidirectional `"01"`, all with `field_prediction == 1`) now reconstruct
  to pixels. `field_forward_prediction` / `field_backward_prediction` /
  `field_bidirectional_prediction` reconstruct the top/bottom field MVs
  through the round-53 `FieldPmvBank` (§7.7.2.2 `PMV[k].y = 2*(PMV[k].y/2
  + MVD[i].y)` with the field-backward bottom-x quirk reading PMV[1]) and
  drive the §7.7.2.1 `field_motion_compensate_one_reference` per active
  direction, then average the bidirectional case with the §7.7.2.2 rule
  `(pred_fwd + pred_bak + 1) >> 1` across luma + 4:2:0 chroma. Both
  half-sample and quarter-sample luma interpolation are wired via the new
  `FieldSampleMode` selector (the qpel path reuses
  `field_motion_compensate_one_reference_qpel`). `BVopFieldReferences`
  bundles the six forward/backward reference planes; `FieldReferenceFlags`
  carries the four §6.3.6.3 `*_field_reference` bits; `FieldMvDeltas`
  carries one direction's top/bottom differentials. Interlaced **direct**
  mode stays out of scope (needs the §7.7.2.2 field-period `TRB[i]` /
  `TRD[i]` + the Table 7-16 `δ` parity selection). 4 tests.
- **§6.2.6 / §7.4 residual-threaded B-VOP frame loop**
  (`BVopMvDriver::decode_vop`): the frame-level §7.6.8 motion walk
  (`decode_vop_motion`) now threads the §6.2.6 / §7.4 texture
  (residual) decode that follows each macroblock's motion bodies into
  a single end-to-end raster-order loop. Per macroblock it decodes the
  motion state, applies the macroblock's `dbquant` delta (Table 6-33,
  §6.3.6) to a running quantiser scale clipped to
  `[1, max_quantiser_scale]`, then consumes the inter residual gated by
  the macroblock's `cbpb`. Returns one `BVopMbTexturedDecode` per
  macroblock (motion state + decoded `InterMacroblock` residual +
  running quantiser scale), each ready to feed
  `BVopMbDecode::reconstruct`. Texture parameters are carried in the
  new `BVopTextureParams { base_quantiser_scale, max_quantiser_scale,
  bits_per_pixel, quant_type }`. New error variant
  `BVopMvDriverError::Texture`. 4 tests cover residual threading,
  running-quantiser dbquant accumulation, the no-`cbpb` zero-residual
  case, and an end-to-end frame decode that drives `decode_vop` and
  reconstructs each macroblock (anchor + residual) via
  `BVopMbDecode::reconstruct`.
- **§6.2.6 / §7.4 B-VOP residual macroblock decoder**
  (`decode_b_vop_inter_macroblock` + `cbpb_pattern_code` in `block`):
  decodes a B-VOP macroblock's §7.4 inter residual (16×16 luma + 8×8
  Cb / 8×8 Cr) from the texture bitstream. Unlike a P-VOP (whose coded
  pattern splits across `cbpy` + `cbpc`), a B-VOP carries a single
  6-bit `cbpb` whose bits run leftmost = top-left block (§6.2.6);
  `cbpb_pattern_code` maps it to the six Figure 6-8 block flags.
  B-VOPs carry no intra macroblocks, so every coded block runs the
  §6.2.7 inter texture syntax (no DC, inter Tcoef tables). `cbpb ==
  None` collapses to a wholly-zero residual consuming no bits. 3 tests.
- **§7.6.8 frame-level B-VOP motion-vector decode driver** (new
  `bvop_mv` module): `BVopMvDriver` walks the macroblocks of one
  progressive, non-scalable B-VOP in raster order, decoding each
  one's §6.2.6 header (`parse_b_vop_mb_header`) + motion bodies
  (`decode_b_vop_mb_motion_vectors`), resolving the §7.6.9 prediction
  mode (direct / forward / backward / bidirectional), and
  reconstructing the forward / backward MVs against the §7.6.8 running
  per-direction predictor bank — reset to zero at each row start
  (`start_row`), updated only after a macroblock that decoded a vector
  in that direction (forward-only → forward predictor; backward-only →
  backward; bidirectional → both). Direct-mode MBs neither read nor
  update the bank: their delta is decoded with predictor zero +
  f_code 1 (§7.6.8) and scaled from the co-located anchor MV by
  §7.6.9.5.2 TRB/TRD. The §6.2.6 `modb "1"` vs `"01"` discriminator is
  resolved via the new `BVopMbHeader::mb_type_present` flag: a
  `modb == "1"` direct MB codes **no** motion body (implicit zero
  delta). §7.6.9.6 skipped-co-located overrides apply before any
  `mb_type` decode (`modb == "1"` → direct/zero-delta; else
  forward/zero-MV). Emits `BVopMbDecode` (prediction mode + four
  `(MVF, MVB)` sub-block pairs + §7.6.5-reduced chroma MVs) ready for
  the §7.6.9→§7.3 `predict_b_vop_macroblock` bridge. Surfaces
  `BVopMvDriver` / `BVopMbDecode` / `BVopMvDriverError`. 6 tests.
- **Frame-level B-VOP motion walk** (`bvop_mv` module):
  `BVopMvDriver::decode_vop_motion(br, vol, vop_coding_type,
  co_located)` decodes the motion state of an entire progressive B-VOP
  in raster order, returning one `BVopMbDecode` per macroblock. It
  applies the §7.6.8 row-start predictor reset internally (calling
  `start_row` at each row boundary) and threads the running per-direction
  predictor bank across the macroblocks of each row. The `co_located`
  closure supplies the §7.6.9.5.1 / §7.6.9.6 anchor state (new
  `CoLocatedAnchor { skipped, mv }`, with a `Default` of
  non-skipped + transparent) for each `(mb_row, mb_col)`. 3 tests cover
  within-row threading, per-row reset, and per-MB anchor dispatch.
- **§7.6.9 → §7.3 B-VOP macroblock reconstruction bridge** (`bvop_mv`
  module): `BVopMbDecode::reconstruct(anchors, residual, mb_origin_x,
  mb_origin_y, vop_rounding_type, mode, bits_per_pixel)` routes a
  driver-decoded macroblock's motion state into
  `reconstruct_b_vop_macroblock`, producing the §7.3 `d[y][x]`
  `ReconstructedMacroblock` (motion-compensated prediction + residual
  add + display clip). The six §7.6.9.5.1-padded anchor planes are
  grouped into the new `BVopAnchorPlanes` struct. 1 test verifies a
  forward-only zero-MV / zero-residual MB copies the forward anchor
  exactly.
- **§7.6 progressive P-VOP motion-vector decode driver** (new `pvop_mv`
  module): `MvDriver` wires the four previously-isolated §7.6 primitives
  — the §6.2.6.2 `motion_vector()` body
  (`decode_motion_vector_delta`), the Figure 7-34 candidate gather
  (`MvGrid::predictor_candidates`), the §7.6.5 median predictor
  (`predict_motion_vector`), and the §7.6.3 / Table 7-9 reconstruct +
  modulo wrap (`reconstruct_motion_vector`) — into an end-to-end,
  raster-order macroblock loop. `decode_macroblock(br, row, col,
  not_coded, mb_type)` dispatches on Table B.1 `derived_mb_type`: a
  `not_coded` MB records a valid zero-MV neighbour (§7.6.2), intra MBs
  record `MbMv::Absent` (an invalid §7.6.5 candidate), inter / inter+q
  decode one MV with the block-0 (top-left) predictor, and inter4v
  decodes four MVs, **incrementally** re-recording the cell after each
  block so the in-MB Figure 7-34 candidates (blocks 2/3/4 →
  blocks 1/2/3) are visible to the next block's median. `reset_packet`
  invalidates the current row's earlier MBs at a §7.6.5 video-packet /
  GOB boundary. Surfaces `PvopMbMotion` / `PvopMvError`. 7 tests.
- **§7.6.2 P-VOP luma prediction-block generator** (`pvop_mv` module):
  `predict_luma_macroblock(motion, reference, mb_x, mb_y,
  vop_rounding_type)` bridges a driver-decoded `PvopMbMotion` to a
  concrete 16×16 half-sample-interpolated luma prediction block — a
  zero-MV co-located copy for a skipped MB, a single 16×16
  `interpolate_block` for inter / inter+q, four tiled 8×8 blocks (one
  per Figure 6-8 sub-block) for inter4v, and `None` for intra (no §7.6.2
  prediction). New end-to-end test drives a synthetic 2×2-macroblock
  progressive P-VOP motion-vector bitstream through `MvDriver` and
  predicts the whole 32×32 frame from a gradient reference, asserting
  the raster-order predictor threading and the half-sample diagonal
  bilinear against a closed form. +5 tests (12 total in the module).
- **§6.1.3.4 / §7.6.5 P-VOP chroma-MV derivation + chroma prediction**
  (`pvop_mv` module): `chroma_mv_for_macroblock(motion)` derives the
  4:2:0 chrominance motion vector from a driver-decoded `PvopMbMotion`
  via the §7.6.5 `sum / 2K` reduction (`chroma_mv_from_luma_blocks`,
  K=1 for inter / inter+q, K=4 for inter4v, `(0,0)` for skipped, `None`
  for intra), and `predict_chroma_macroblock` half-sample-interpolates
  the 8×8 Cb / Cr prediction block from a chroma reference plane. +5
  tests (970 lib total).
- **§7.6.2 → §7.3 P-VOP prediction-macroblock bridge** (`pvop_mv`
  module): `predict_inter_macroblock(motion, luma_ref, cb_ref, cr_ref,
  mb_x, mb_y, vop_rounding_type)` packs the §7.6.2.1 half-sample
  prediction of a driver-decoded `PvopMbMotion` into the row-major
  `InterPredictionMacroblock` (`[[i32; 16]; 16]` luma + `[[i32; 8]; 8]`
  Cb/Cr) that `reconstruct::reconstruct_inter_macroblock` adds the §7.4
  residual to — closing the gap between the flat-`Vec<u8>` §7.6.2 block
  generators and the §7.3 `d = p + f` reconstruction layer. Derives the
  4:2:0 chroma origin `(mb_x / 2, mb_y / 2)` per §6.1.3.4 and returns
  `None` for intra. +3 tests (973 lib total).
- **§7.6.2 + §7.3 end-to-end P-VOP inter-macroblock reconstruction**
  (`pvop_mv` module): `reconstruct_pvop_macroblock(motion, luma_ref,
  cb_ref, cr_ref, residual, mb_x, mb_y, vop_rounding_type,
  bits_per_pixel)` is the single call that closes the
  progressive-P-VOP motion-compensation path — it runs
  `predict_inter_macroblock` (§7.6.2.1) and feeds the result plus the
  decoded §7.4 residual into the §7.3 step-2 add + step-3
  `[0, 2^bpp - 1]` display clip, returning the `d[y][x]`
  `ReconstructedMacroblock` ready to blit into the frame buffer (`None`
  for intra, which takes the §7.4 intra texture + §7.3 step-1 path). A
  new frame-level test drives the four-macroblock motion bitstream
  through `MvDriver`, reconstructs every MB against a reference frame,
  blits luma + 4:2:0 chroma into a 32×32 / 16×16 frame buffer, and
  cross-checks the assembled luma against the per-MB §7.6.2 prediction
  and a closed-form half-pel diagonal bilinear. +3 tests (976 lib
  total).
- **§7.6.9 + §7.3 end-to-end B-VOP macroblock reconstruction**
  (`bvop_prediction` module): `predict_b_vop_macroblock` packs the
  §7.6.9 forward / backward / bidirectional / direct prediction
  (luma via `generate_b_vop_luma_prediction`, 4:2:0 chroma via
  `generate_b_vop_chroma_prediction` against the §7.6.5-reduced chroma
  MVs) into the row-major `InterPredictionMacroblock`, and
  `reconstruct_b_vop_macroblock` feeds it plus the decoded §7.4 residual
  through the §7.3 step-2 add + step-3 `[0, 2^bpp - 1]` display clip,
  returning the `d[y][x]` `ReconstructedMacroblock` — the B-VOP analogue
  of the P-VOP `reconstruct_pvop_macroblock` bridge. Both anchor VOPs
  (forward + backward) and all three planes per anchor are threaded
  through; the chroma origin is derived `(mb_origin_x / 2,
  mb_origin_y / 2)` per §6.1.3.4. +3 tests (979 lib total).
- **§6.2.3 static-sprite VOL body + §7.8.2/§7.8.6 reconstruction**
  (`vol`, `static_sprite` modules): the `sprite_enable == static` VOL
  branch now parses (the `sprite_{width,height,left,top}` geometry
  quadruple + `low_latency_sprite_enable`), surfaced as
  `VolHeader::sprite_geometry: Option<SpriteGeometry>` and
  `VolHeader::low_latency_sprite_enable`. The new `static_sprite` module
  warps a basic static sprite (`low_latency == 0`) onto the visible VOP:
  `SpriteMemory` implements §7.8.2 absolute-coordinate addressing
  (`(left, top)` origin + §7.6.4 edge clamp), `static_sprite_luma` /
  `_chroma` / `_luma_macroblock` apply the §7.8.6 *static* blend
  (bilinear, `//`-rounded, **no** `s²/2 − rounding_control` GMC bias)
  plus the §7.8.6 `brightness_change_factor` post-adjustment. Reuses the
  existing §7.8.4/§7.8.5 `WarpGeometry`. 9 tests.
- **§6.3.6 / §7.8.7.1 mcsel-gated S(GMC)-VOP prediction routing**
  (`s_gmc_recon` module): `s_gmc_prediction_macroblock(mcsel, …)` wires
  the §6.3.6 `mcsel` flag into the §7.3 recon loop — `mcsel == 1` warps
  the reference VOP into a 4:2:0 `InterPredictionMacroblock` via the new
  `gmc_prediction_macroblock` (frame prediction even when interlaced,
  per §7.8.7.1), `mcsel == 0` passes the caller's translational
  prediction through unchanged. `GmcReferencePlanes` bundles the three
  reference planes. 3 tests (passthrough, GMC override, per-MB parity
  with direct `gmc_luma_prediction`/`gmc_chroma_prediction`).
- **§7.6.8 four-PMV interlaced-B-VOP field motion-vector predictor**
  (`bvop_field_predictor` module): the Table 7-14 / Table 7-15 PMV bank
  (top/bottom forward, top/bottom backward) with per-mode read/update —
  frame forward/backward/bidirectional (progressive `MV = PMV + MVD`,
  both field PMVs set equal), field forward/backward/bidirectional
  (`y = 2·(PMV.y/2 + MVD.y)`, vertical even), direct (no-op). Reproduces
  the §7.6.8 field-backward quirk (bottom-field x reads PMV[1]) and the
  per-MB-row `reset_row()` that direct/skipped MBs don't trigger. 10
  tests.
- **§7.3.5 / Table 7-2 inverse-transform selection** (`transform_select`
  module): the per-8×8-block decision that routes a decoded `PQF[v][u]`
  coefficient block to one of the three already-implemented inverse
  transforms. `select_transform` transcribes the three Table 7-2 rows
  verbatim — 8×8-DCT when `rectangular || sadct_disable || opaque_pels ==
  64`; ∆DC-SA-DCT for non-B intra blocks (`derived_mb_type ∈ {3,4}`) of
  a non-rectangular `sadct_disable == 0` `opaque_pels < 64` VOL; SA-DCT
  for the remaining P-VOP-inter / B-VOP-intra / B-VOP-inter cases (incl.
  the subtle B-VOP-intra → plain-SA-DCT case the ∆DC `!= "B"` gate
  excludes). `inverse_transform_block` / `select_and_inverse_transform`
  apply the chosen transform. 16 tests: per-row coverage, exhaustiveness
  over the SA-DCT space, and dispatch-matches-body for all three arms.
- **§6.3.6 S(GMC)-VOP macroblock layer** (`macroblock`): the
  macroblock-header parser now decodes S(GMC)-VOP macroblocks
  (`sprite_enable == "GMC"`) instead of rejecting all S-VOPs. They share
  the P-VOP MCBPC type table and not-coded syntax and additionally carry
  the §6.3.6 `mcsel` flag (GMC vs. local-MC reference, present for inter /
  inter+q types) via the new `MacroblockHeader::mcsel` field and the
  `MacroblockHeader::SKIPPED_GMC` not-coded constant (implied `mcsel == 1`
  per §6.3.6). Interlaced routing follows §6.2.6.3 / line 11715: an
  `mcsel == 1` GMC macroblock invokes no `interlaced_information()` body.
  Static-sprite S-VOPs and B-VOPs remain typed-rejected. 8 new tests.
- Round 53 of the clean-room rebuild — **GMC subsystem, part 4
  (§7.8.6 sample reconstruction)**: a new `gmc` module that warps a
  reference VOP into a GMC prediction macroblock. `gmc_luma_prediction`
  fills a 16×16 luma block and `gmc_chroma_prediction` an 8×8 chroma
  block: for each destination pixel it evaluates the §7.8.5
  `(F,G)`/`(Fc,Gc)` warp, floors it to an integer reference position
  (`////s`, truncation toward −∞), derives the `1/s`-pel residuals `ri`
  / `rj`, fetches the four surrounding reference samples with §7.6.4
  last-full-pel clamping, and applies the §7.8.6 GMC bilinear blend
  `Y = ((s−rj)((s−ri)Y00 + ri Y01) + rj((s−ri)Y10 + ri Y11) + s²/2 −
  rounding_control) / s²`, clipped to `[0, 2^bpp − 1]`. This closes the
  GMC syntax → geometry → reconstruction path end-to-end: a parsed
  S(GMC)-VOP trajectory now drives a real prediction block. Tests
  verify the `////` floor division, a flat reference warping flat, the
  0-point identity reducing to an integer-pel copy, a 1-pel integer
  translation sampling the shifted reference column, a half-pel shift
  producing the exact two-column average, the chroma path, and the
  `vop_rounding_type` half-case down-bias.
- Round 53 of the clean-room rebuild — **GMC subsystem, part 3
  (reference-point + warping geometry)**: a new `warp` module
  implementing §7.8.4 sprite reference-point decoding and §7.8.5
  warping. `WarpGeometry::decode` turns a [`SpriteTrajectory`] + VOP
  `W`/`H` + `sprite_warping_accuracy` into the sprite reference points
  `(i0',j0')` / `(i1',j1')` / `(i2',j2')` (`1/s`-pel), the virtual
  sprite points `(i1'',j1'')` / `(i2'',j2'')` for 2/3-point affine
  warps, and the derived `r = 16/s`, `W'`/`H'` (smallest powers of two
  `>= W`/`H`) and their exponents. `luma_fg(i,j)` / `chroma_fg(ic,jc)`
  evaluate the §7.8.5 `(F,G)` / `(Fc,Gc)` transforms for all GMC point
  counts (0 stationary, 1 translation incl. the GMC-specific chroma
  `(i0'>>1)|(i0'&1)` form, 2/3 affine), mapping a destination VOP pixel
  to a `1/s`-pel reference coordinate. The §3.4 `///` operator (sign-
  dependent rounding to nearest) is implemented exactly as `div_sdr`
  (`3 /// 2 == 2`, `-3 /// 2 == -1`) and `// ` as `div_half`; the spec's
  power-of-two shift rewrites are equivalent and folded into the exact
  forms. Two OCR ambiguities in the §7.8.5 listing (the garbled
  `2^(α+ρ−1)` rounding offset and the `−16 i0` terms) are documented in
  the source. Tests verify: the `///`/`// ` rounding examples, the
  `r`/`rho` and `W'`/`alpha` derivations, the 0-point identity
  (`F = s·i`), single-point pure translation, the 2- and 3-point
  zero-trajectory reduction to the identity affine, and the
  degenerate-affine pure-translation case.
- Round 53 of the clean-room rebuild — **GMC subsystem, part 2
  (sprite-trajectory syntax)**: a new `sprite` module decoding the
  §6.2.5 `sprite_trajectory()` body for S(GMC)-VOPs.
  `decode_warping_mv_code` reads one §6.3.5.4 `warping_mv_code()`
  codeword — the unary `dmv_length` (`SSS`) VLC, the `SSS`-bit FLC
  `dmv_code`, and the trailing `marker_bit` — and reconstructs the
  signed differential per Table B.34 ("Code table for the first
  trajectory point"): `SSS == k` selects a value in
  `{ -(2^k-1)..-2^(k-1), 2^(k-1)..2^k-1 }`, top-bit-set codes mapping
  to the positive half. `decode_sprite_trajectory` walks the
  `no_of_sprite_warping_points` `du[i]`/`dv[i]` pairs into a `Copy`
  `SpriteTrajectory` (max 3 points for GMC; perspective is rejected at
  the VOL). The §6.2.5 VOP-header parser now follows the S(GMC)-VOP
  sprite branch: after `intra_dc_vlc_thr` + interlaced flags it reads
  `sprite_trajectory()` (when `no_of_sprite_warping_points > 0`),
  surfaces it on the new `VopHeader::sprite_trajectory` field, and —
  unlike the static path — falls through to `vop_quant` /
  `vop_fcode_forward` exactly like a P-VOP (the GMC branch has no
  `return()`). The static-sprite S-VOP stays typed-rejected. Tests
  cover the Table B.34 SSS=0/1/2/5 codeword mappings, the marker-bit
  and overflow rejections, a 2-point affine trajectory round-trip, the
  stationary (0-point) GMC fall-through, and the static rejection.
- Round 53 of the clean-room rebuild — **GMC subsystem, part 1
  (configuration syntax)**: the §6.2.3 `sprite_enable == "GMC"` VOL
  body. `parse_video_object_layer` now decodes
  `no_of_sprite_warping_points` (Table 6-20: `0` stationary, `1`
  translation, `2`/`3` affine — `4` perspective is typed-rejected as
  disallowed under GMC, `5..=63` rejected as `ReservedWarpingPoints`),
  `sprite_warping_accuracy` (Table 6-21 → new `SpriteWarpingAccuracy`
  enum with `s()` returning the `2 / 4 / 8 / 16` sub-pel denominator),
  and `sprite_brightness_change` (mandated `0` under GMC, a non-zero
  bit is rejected). The GMC branch correctly skips the static-only
  `sprite_width` / `sprite_height` / coordinate fields and the
  `low_latency_sprite_enable` bit (all gated `if (sprite_enable !=
  "GMC")` in §6.2.3). The `static` branch stays typed-rejected — it
  needs the §7.8.2 sprite-object buffer + §7.8.3 piece-update
  machinery, out of scope for the GMC milestone. New `VolHeader`
  fields `no_of_sprite_warping_points` / `sprite_warping_accuracy` /
  `sprite_brightness_change` (all `Option`, `None` when sprite coding
  is off). Tests cover the affine 2-point body, the stationary
  0-point body, the perspective-rejection and reserved-count paths,
  and the accuracy → `s` mapping.
  ∆DC-SA-DCT is the transform used for intra-coded 8×8 blocks of a
  non-rectangular VOP with `opaque_pels < 64`: the encoder separates the
  block mean before the forward SA-DCT (∆S1) and re-injects it as a scaled
  `F[0][0] = 8·mean_value` (∆S3). The decoder undoes this in steps
  I-∆S1..I-∆S4:
  - **I-∆S1** extracts `mean_value = F[0][0] / 8` and zeroes `F[0][0]`.
  - **I-∆S2** runs the inverse SA-DCT body (I-S1..I-S5) on the modified
    coefficients, refactored to a shared floating-point core
    (`inverse_sadct_float`) so the correction operates on the unrounded
    `f[y][x]` per Annex A NOTE 2.
  - **I-∆S3** derives the correction term `corr_term = check_sum / sqrt_sum`,
    with `check_sum = Σ f[y][x]` over opaque samples and
    `sqrt_sum = Σ √pels_height[x]` over non-empty columns.
  - **I-∆S4** adds `mean_value − corr_term/√pels_height[x]` to every opaque
    sample and rounds to integers.
  Tests cover the flat-mean reconstruction, the closed-form I-∆S4 additive
  identity, the zero-correction degenerate case, and a full forward/inverse
  round-trip through a test-local forward SA-DCT.
- Round 51 of the clean-room rebuild: the Annex A §A.3.2 **inverse
  shape-adaptive DCT** (SA-DCT) transform body — steps I-S1..I-S5 — in a
  new `inverse_sadct` module. This is the §7.3.5 / Table 7-2 transform
  that replaces the textbook 8×8 inverse DCT in non-rectangular VOPs
  (`sadct_disable == 0`) for blocks with `opaque_pels < 64`. It consumes
  the `PQF[v][u]` layout produced by the §7.4.2 modified inverse scan and
  reconverts it to decoded texture `f[y][x]`:
  - **I-S1** re-derives the full shape-parameter set (`coeff_width[v]`,
    `pels_height[x]`, `shift_shape[y][x]`) from the decoded binary shape
    `f_shape[y][x]` — the `coeff_width` / `opaque_pels` halves already
    drove the scan; the transform also needs `pels_height` and
    `shift_shape` for the re-shifts.
  - **I-S2 / I-S4** apply variable-length, shape-adaptive 1-D inverse
    DCTs (`coeff_width[v]`-point per row, then `pels_height[x]`-point per
    column) using the orthonormal `√(2/N)` / `C(0)=√0.5` kernel with `N`
    taken from the shape parameter rather than fixed at 8.
  - **I-S3 / I-S5** re-shift the intermediate coefficients and final
    pels from their left-/top-packed positions back to the original
    column/row positions defined by `shift_shape` / `f_shape`.
  Floating-point per Annex A NOTE 3, output rounded half-away-from-zero
  (§4.1). Two transcription typos in the ISO listing (`coff_count` in
  I-S3, the missing `[pels_count]` row index in I-S5) are documented and
  corrected. 8 new tests: the full-opaque block reduces exactly to the
  Annex A §A.1 8×8 IDCT, DC-only flat reconstruction, single-opaque-row
  and single-opaque-column DC behaviour, staircase shape-param
  invariants, transparent-position and all-zero-block guarantees.
- Round 50 of the clean-room rebuild: the §7.4.2 **modified inverse
  scan** for the `sadct_disable == 0` shape-adaptive-DCT path. In a
  non-rectangular VOP, an 8×8 block with fewer than 64 opaque pels
  carries only `opaque_pels` SA-DCT coefficients, packed `coeff_width[v]`
  per row against the left edge. New `scan::modified_inverse_scan`
  implements the spec's `coeff_width`-aware loop — it walks the chosen
  Figure 7-4 scan path, writes a decoded coefficient only where
  `coeff_width[v] > u`, and zero-fills every SA-DCT-undefined position
  (§7.4.2 NOTE 1, so subsequent AC prediction is not confused). The
  auxiliary `coeff_width[v]` array and the `opaque_pels` total are
  derived from the decoded 8×8 binary shape via
  `scan::ShapeParams::from_shape`, transcribing Annex A §A.3.2 step
  I-S1 (per-column vertical shift of opaque pels, then a per-row count).
  `scan::events_to_pqf_sadct` is the one-call EVENTs → `PQF[v][u]`
  convenience for the SA-DCT path. 13 new tests cover the shape-param
  derivation (full / empty / quadrant / non-contiguous vertical-shift /
  staircase / L-shape), the full-width equivalence to the plain inverse
  scan, the zero-fill constraint, scan-order coefficient packing, and
  the `coeff_count == opaque_pels` invariant.
- Round 49 of the clean-room rebuild: the §E.1.4.4.2.1 **two-way RVLC
  error-recovery strategy selection** — the arbitration that decides,
  after both the forward and the backward `reversible_vlc == 1` Tcoef
  decodes have run, how many macroblocks to keep from the beginning
  (forward result) and how many from the end (backward result), with
  the straddling middle discarded. New `src/rvlc_arbitration.rs`:
  `RvlcArbitration::select(&RvlcArbitrationInput)` classifies the packet
  into one of the four §E.1.4.4.2.1 strategies from the two predicates
  `L1 + L2 >= L` (decodable-bit overlap) and `N1 + N2 >= N`
  (completely-decoded-MB overlap), then computes `keep_front` /
  `keep_back` from the strategy's formula — Strategy 1 `f_mb(L1-T)` /
  `b_mb(L2-T)`, Strategy 2 `N-N2-1` / `N-N1-1`, Strategy 3 `N-b_mb(L2)`
  / `N-f_mb(L1)`, Strategy 4 the `min` of the two. The `f_mb(S)` /
  `b_mb(S)` step-inverse counters are evaluated over per-MB cumulative
  bit-cost tables (`partition_point`), with the §E.1.4.4.2 counter rule
  (a non-positive `S` yields 0). `RVLC_THRESHOLD` exposes the spec's
  `T = 90`. The two kept regions are clamped disjoint so the discard
  region never goes negative. `RvlcArbitration::displayed_mbs` applies
  the §E.1.4.4.2.2 INTRA-MB concealment pass — every INTRA MB in an
  errored packet is concealed (not displayed), even one a strategy
  would otherwise have kept. Nine unit tests cover each strategy's
  formula, the step-inverse counters, the disjoint-region clamp, the
  `0 <= N1,N2 <= N-1` bound, and the concealment pass. Re-exported at
  the crate root.
- Round 48 of the clean-room rebuild: the §E.1.4.4 **backward
  (reverse-direction) reversible-VLC Tcoef decode** — the second half of
  the Annex E two-way RVLC error-recovery method (round 47 landed the
  forward half). A new `BackwardBitReader` (`src/bitreader.rs`) reads a
  half-open absolute bit range `[start_bit, end_bit)` from `end_bit`
  toward `start_bit` (`read_bit_reverse` emits stream bits tail-first;
  `read_bits_value(n)` reassembles a fixed-length field in forward bit
  order). `decode_ac_event_rvlc_reverse` decodes one EVENT in reverse:
  the sign bit `s` is consumed first, then the four bits below it select
  the common path (a Table B.23 reversible VLC, matched against its
  bit-reversed code — RVLC codes are reverse-decodable by construction,
  §E.1.3) or the Type-5 escape, whose closing `0000` delimiter is the
  escape marker in the reverse direction (`00001` is *not* used backward,
  §E.1.4.4.1). The escape payload `m LEVEL(11) m RUN(6) LAST(1)` is read
  in reverse order, terminating with the `00001` opener (tail-first
  `10000`). `decode_ac_events_rvlc_reverse(data, start_bit, end_bit,
  table_kind)` runs the reverse loop over a video-packet DCT-coefficient
  region across block boundaries and returns the recovered EVENTs in
  **forward** scan order; per Annex E, a mid-region illegal RVLC stops
  the decode while preserving the already-recovered trailing EVENTs. A
  new `TextureParseError::RvlcEscapeOpenerMissing { window }` flags a
  malformed backward opener. `reverse_bits(code, len)` bit-reverses a
  forward codeword for the reverse match. 13 new tests: backward-reader
  tail-first emission / forward-field reassembly / start-bound, the
  `reverse_bits` roundtrip, forward↔backward equality on common-path and
  escape sequences (single + multi-EVENT, intra + inter column), the
  longest 15-bit code, the Annex-E error-recovery tail-preservation, and
  first-EVENT error propagation. (843 lib tests, +12.)
- Round 47 of the clean-room rebuild: the §7.4.1.2 reversible-VLC Tcoef
  decode for the `reversible_vlc == 1` path. A new `rvlc_tables.rs`
  transcribes Table B.23 — the 169 reversible EVENTs, each carrying both
  its intra `(LAST, RUN, LEVEL)` and inter `(LAST, RUN, LEVEL)` triple
  under one prefix-free code (selected by the existing `TcoefTable`
  argument). `decode_ac_event_rvlc` decodes one EVENT: the common path
  is a Table B.23 code plus its trailing sign bit `s`; combinations not
  in the table use the §7.4.1.3 Type-5 escape (the only escape mode
  permitted when `reversible_vlc == 1`) — opener `00001`, fixed-length
  `LAST(1) RUN(6) marker LEVEL(11) marker`, closing delimiter `0000`,
  sign bit `s`, with the 11-bit unsigned LEVEL magnitude per Table B.25
  (`0` forbidden) and the 6-bit RUN per Table B.24.
  `decode_ac_events_rvlc` runs the §6.2.7 `while (!last)` loop. A new
  `TextureParseError::RvlcEscapeDelimiterMissing { window }` flags a
  malformed closing delimiter; the existing `EscapeMarkerBitMissing` and
  `ReservedEscapeLevel` cover the marker bits and the forbidden LEVEL.
  The escape opener `00001` is prefix-disjoint from every Table B.23
  code (none begins with `0000`), so the common and escape paths are
  distinguished by the leading five bits. 13 new tests (prefix-freeness
  + 169-entry count, intra/inter column divergence, longest 16-bit code,
  Type-5 positive/negative escapes, forbidden-LEVEL / marker / delimiter
  / invalid-code rejections, event loop). (831 lib tests, +13.)
- Round 46 of the clean-room rebuild: §7.7.2.1 / Figure 7-46 / Figure
  7-47 field-aware spatial neighbour selection, closing the round-45
  follow-up. A new `MbMv::Field { top, bottom }` records a
  field-predicted neighbour's two field motion vectors;
  `MvGrid::record_field` / `MbMvRecord::field` set it.
  `MvGrid::field_predictor_candidates(mb_row, mb_col)` (and the free
  `gather_field_mv_predictor_candidates`) resolve the three Figure 7-46 /
  7-47 macroblock-level positions (`MV1` left, `MV2` above, `MV3`
  above-right — coinciding with the §7.6.5 frame-mode top-left-block
  layout) into a `[FieldPredCandidate; 3]` ready for round 45's
  `predict_field_motion_vector`. A frame-predicted neighbour (`OneMv`, or
  — per the §7.7.2.1 "8x8 block motion vector closest to the upper left
  block of the current MB" rule — the selected sub-block of a `FourMv`)
  → `FieldPredCandidate::Frame`; a field-predicted neighbour →
  `FieldPredCandidate::Field`; an absent / transparent / out-of-VOP
  neighbour → `FieldPredCandidate::Invalid`. The existing frame-mode
  `MvGrid::predictor_candidates` query now collapses a `Field` neighbour
  to its `Div2Round(MVf1 + MVf2)` frame candidate (§7.7.2.1 CASE 2 /
  Figure 7-47, also the §7.6.6 OBMC adjacent-field-MB rule). With this
  the interlaced P-VOP field-prediction path is end-to-end (parse rounds
  39–42, predictor selection round 45 + gathering this round,
  reconstruction round 43, half-/quarter-sample field MC rounds 43/44).
  9 new tests. (818 lib tests, +9; 12 doc, +1.)
- Round 45 of the clean-room rebuild: §7.7.2.1 field-MV predictor
  selection (CASE 1 / CASE 2 / CASE 3), closing the round-43/44
  follow-up. New `FieldPredCandidate` enum (`Frame` /
  `Field { top, bottom }` / `Invalid`) classifies each §7.6.5 spatial
  neighbour, and `predict_field_motion_vector([FieldPredCandidate; 3])`
  maps a field-predicted neighbour to its per-component
  `Div2Round(MVf1 + MVf2)` average (Figure 7-47), a frame-predicted
  neighbour to its frame MV, applies the four §7.6.5 validity rules,
  and medians component-wise to the shared `(Px, Py)` predictor. CASE 1
  reduces to the progressive median; CASE 2 feeds `MVx = MVDx + Px` /
  `MVy = MVDy + Py`; CASE 3 feeds the shared predictor into
  `reconstruct_field_motion_vectors`. 6 new tests. (809 lib tests.)
- Round 44 of the clean-room rebuild: §7.6.2.2 quarter-sample field
  motion compensation, closing the round-43 follow-up. A new
  `FieldRefView` (`src/quarter_sample.rs`) presents one field of the
  progressive reference plane as a contiguous line grid (field-line `n`
  → frame line `field_y0 + 2n`, §7.6.4 clamp applied in field-line
  space), realising the §7.6.2 interlaced rule "vertically interpolated
  between two successive lines of the same field … the vertical
  coordinates of the integer samples differ by 2". The §7.6.2.2.1/.2
  8-tap-FIR + bilinear quarter-pel cascade is now generic over a
  `QpelSource` trait — the same math runs on the frame plane or a
  `FieldRefView` with no duplication, and the public `half_pel_b/c/d`,
  `interpolate_quarter_pixel`, and `interpolate_block_qpel*` signatures
  are unchanged. `field_mvy_to_field_grid(mvy)` halves the always-even
  (§7.7.2.1) frame-coordinate field MVy into a field-grid quarter-pel
  coordinate. `interpolate_block_qpel_field[_into](…, ref_field_y0, …)`
  interpolates a 16×8 luma field block.
  `field_motion_compensate_one_reference_qpel(…, bits_per_pixel)`
  (`src/field_motion.rs`) replaces the two luma `mc` calls of the
  half-sample driver with quarter-pel field-block interpolation (top
  output field → even rows, bottom → odd) and keeps the four §7.7.2.1
  chroma `mc` calls in half-sample field mode; per §7.7.2.2 the
  quarter-sample chroma MV is
  `div2_round(half_pel_chroma_mv_from_qpel(c))` (`Div2Round` of the
  luma qpel component divided by 2, `/` truncating toward 0). 17 tests
  pin the path. (803 lib tests, +17.)

- Round 43 of the clean-room rebuild: §7.7.2.1 field-MV reconstruction
  + the field motion-compensation driver (`src/field_motion.rs`), so an
  interlaced P-VOP field-predicted macroblock reconstructs pixels.
  `reconstruct_field_motion_vectors(pair, px, py)` turns a decoded
  `FieldMvPair` differential + the shared `(Px, Py)` predictor into the
  two final field MVs per `MVx fi = MVDx fi + Px`,
  `MVy fi = 2 * (MVDy fi + (Py / 2))` (vertical component always even in
  half-pel frame coordinates). `mc(...)` reproduces the §7.7.2.1 /
  §7.6.2 half-sample reference routine verbatim with the `pred_y0` /
  `ref_y0` / `y_incr` field parameters — `y_incr = 2` writes only every
  other destination line and averages the two adjacent same-field
  reference lines (`y_ref`, `y_ref + 2`). `div2_round(x) =
  (x >> 1) | (x & 1)` derives the chrominance field MVs.
  `field_motion_compensate_one_reference(...)` issues the six §7.7.2.1
  `mc` calls (top/bottom luma, then top/bottom Cb / Cr) and assembles an
  `InterPredictionMacroblock` ready for the §7.3 residual add. The
  output field is selected by `pred_y0`; the reference field by the
  `forward_top_field_reference` / `forward_bottom_field_reference`
  flags through `ref_y0`. 12 tests pin the path (Div2Round bit
  definition, even-vertical reconstruction, truncation-toward-0 of
  `Py / 2`, frame/field `mc` equivalence, same-field vertical half-pel
  averaging, independent top/bottom reference-field selection, and the
  end-to-end field-MC + §7.3 residual-add reconstruction with display
  clip). Half-sample mode only; quarter-sample field MC is a follow-up.

- Round 42 of the clean-room rebuild: §6.2.6 B-VOP motion-vector
  bodies + interlaced field-prediction second `motion_vector()`
  invocations. `decode_field_motion_vector_pair` decodes the
  unconditional body plus the `if (interlaced && field_prediction)`
  second one into `FieldMvPair { top, bottom }` (§7.7.2.1 ordering:
  top-field differential first; both bodies share the direction's
  fcode). `decode_p_macroblock_motion_vectors_interlaced` extends the
  round-37 P-VOP walker with the field route
  (`PMbMotionVectors::{Frame, Field}`); the new
  `MotionParseError::InvalidFieldPredictionContext` rejects
  `field_prediction` combinations §6.2.6.3 cannot code (inter4v /
  intra rows, direct mode) without consuming bits.
  `decode_b_vop_mb_motion_vectors` walks the §6.2.6 Table B.4 branch
  after `parse_b_vop_mb_header`: forward body for `mb_type == '01' ||
  '0001'`, backward for `'01' || '001'` (syntax order, backward gated
  on `vop_fcode_backward`), single residual-less
  `motion_vector("direct")` for `'1'`; each direction surfaces
  `BVopMvBody::Frame` or `::Field`, with field-interpolated
  macroblocks decoding four bodies in the §7.7.2.2 / Table 7-14
  `MVD[0..3]` order (forward-top, forward-bottom, backward-top,
  backward-bottom). New `BVopMbParseError::Motion` wraps body-level
  failures. Reconstruction (`MVy fi = 2 * (MVDy fi + (Py / 2))`) and
  §7.7.2 field motion compensation stay later-round work. 17 new unit
  tests; total crate test count now 774 + 9 doc.
- Round 41 of the clean-room rebuild: §6.2.6 B-VOP `if (interlaced)
  interlaced_information()` dispatch wiring. `parse_b_vop_mb_header`
  now consumes the §6.2.6.3 body (round 39's
  `parse_interlaced_information`) immediately after the (optional)
  `dbquant` and before the (later-round) motion-vector bodies,
  completing the dispatch work round 40 left open. The §6.2.6 B-VOP
  layer places the call inside two enclosing gates the I/P-VOP layer
  does not have: the `if (modb != '1')` subtree (a `modb == '1'`
  macroblock skips everything after `modb`, including the body) and
  the `if (ref_select_code != '00' || !scalability)` branch — the
  scalable enhancement-layer path (Table B.5, `BMbTypeTable::B5`)
  carries no `interlaced_information()` line in §6.2.6, so an
  interlaced VOL on that path still yields `None`. The gate is driven
  by `mb_type_present` rather than the raw `modb` value (the Table
  B.3 raw codes `1` and `01` are numerically identical as integers).
  The §6.2.6.3 first gate's `cbp != 0` predicate is `cbpb != 0`, with
  an absent `cbpb` (`modb == '01'`) collapsing to `cbp == 0`. The
  dispatch fires for Direct macroblocks too (the §6.2.6 line is
  unconditional within the Table B.4 branch); §6.2.6.3 then
  suppresses `field_prediction` via its `mb_type != "1"` clause, so a
  Direct MB carries at most the `dct_type` bit. New field
  `BVopMbHeader::interlaced_info: Option<InterlacedInformation>`
  surfaces the decoded body via the round-39
  `InterlacedInfoContext::b_vop` context. Out of scope (later
  rounds): the B-VOP motion-vector bodies and their `if (interlaced
  && field_prediction) motion_vector(…)` second invocations. With
  this, every macroblock-header parser in the crate (I-VOP / P-VOP /
  B-VOP) routes the §6.2.6 interlaced dispatch. 9 new unit tests:
  progressive-VOL no-body, `modb == '1'` skip, Direct `cbpb != 0`
  dct-only, Direct `cbpb == 0` zero-bit body, Interpolated full
  6-bit body after `dbquant`, Forward `modb == '01'` 1-bit
  `field_prediction == 0` body, Backward backward-pair-only body,
  Table B.5 no-dispatch, and a mid-body truncation — each with a
  sentinel bit-position check. Total crate test count now 757 + 9
  doc.
- Round 40 of the clean-room rebuild: §6.2.6 `if (interlaced)
  interlaced_information()` dispatch wiring. `parse_macroblock_header`
  now consumes the §6.2.6.3 body (round 39's
  `parse_interlaced_information`) for I- and P-VOP macroblocks when the
  VOL header carries `interlaced == 1`. The call fires immediately
  after `dquant` and before the (later-round) motion / texture data,
  per the §6.2.6 syntax line `if (interlaced)
  interlaced_information()`. The §6.2.6.3 first gate's `cbp != 0`
  predicate is derived from the macroblock header's coded-block
  pattern (`cbpy != 0 || cbpc != 0`, both already in the §6.3.7
  "1 == coded" convention — the inter `cbpy` column of Table B.8 is
  stored in coded-block-pattern form). A new
  `MacroblockHeader::interlaced_info: Option<InterlacedInformation>`
  field surfaces the decoded body: `None` for progressive VOLs and for
  `not_coded` macroblocks (the §6.2.6 not-coded short-circuit returns
  before the `interlaced_information()` call), `Some(_)` for every
  coded macroblock in an interlaced VOL (possibly a zero-bit body when
  neither §6.2.6.3 gate fires). The I-VOP context is built via the
  round-39 checked `InterlacedInfoContext::i_vop` (always carries the
  `dct_type` gate, never `field_prediction`); the P-VOP context via
  `InterlacedInfoContext::p_vop`. A defensive
  `MacroblockParseError::InvalidInterlacedContext` guards an
  inconsistent I-VOP context construction. The S(GMC)-VOP `mcsel`
  route and the §6.2.6 `if (interlaced && field_prediction)
  motion_vector("forward")` second invocation remain out of scope (the
  header parser rejects S-VOPs and stops before motion vectors). 8 new
  unit tests: progressive-VOL no-body, I-VOP dct_type-only, P-VOP
  inter `cbp == 0` field_prediction bit, P-VOP inter `cbp != 0` full
  forward-pair body, P-VOP inter4v zero-bit body with bit-position
  check, P-VOP intra dct_type-only, not_coded skip, and an interlaced
  body truncation that surfaces `Truncated`. Total crate test count now
  748 + 9 doc.
- Round 39 of the clean-room rebuild: §6.2.6.3
  `interlaced_information()` body parser. New
  `src/interlaced_information.rs` decodes the two §6.2.6.3 gates —
  the optional `dct_type` bit (fires when `derived_mb_type ∈ {3, 4}`
  or `cbp != 0`) and the optional `field_prediction` block (fires
  under one of the three §6.2.6.3 disjuncts: P-VOP with
  `derived_mb_type < 2`, S(GMC)-VOP with `derived_mb_type < 2` and
  `!mcsel`, or B-VOP with `mb_type != "1"`). When `field_prediction
  == 1`, up to four reference bits follow — the forward pair
  (`forward_top_field_reference` + `forward_bottom_field_reference`,
  present for P / S / B-non-backward) and the backward pair
  (`backward_top_field_reference` + `backward_bottom_field_reference`,
  B-non-forward only). `parse_interlaced_information(br, ctx)`
  consumes 0..=6 bits depending on which gates fire and never emits
  a flag whose syntax-level guard is not satisfied.
  `InterlacedInfoContext::{i_vop, p_vop, b_vop, s_gmc_vop}` are
  checked constructors that encode the spec's coding-type-specific
  preconditions structurally: I-VOP refuses inter `mb_type`,
  S(GMC)-VOP refuses `derived_mb_type >= 2`, and `s_gmc_vop` with
  `McSel::On` surfaces `None` (the §6.2.6.3 S-disjunct's `!mcsel`
  requirement). `DctType::{Frame, Field}` and `FieldReference::{Top,
  Bottom}` carry the §6.3.6.3 semantics directly.
  `InterlacedInformation::field_prediction_guard_fired` discriminates
  "second gate fired but bit value was 0" from "gate didn't fire" so
  callers know whether to skip the §6.2.6 `if (interlaced &&
  field_prediction) motion_vector("forward")` second invocation.
  `dct_type_present` and `field_prediction_present` are pure
  predicates that surface the gates without parsing. Out of scope
  (later rounds): the §6.2.6 outer `if (interlaced)
  interlaced_information()` dispatch from the macroblock-header
  parsers, and the §7.6.5 / §7.6.2.5 consumption of `dct_type` and
  `field_prediction` by the motion-compensation / block-grouping
  paths. 28 new unit tests covering all 24 reachable
  `InterlacedInfoContext` permutations, the four B-VOP `BVopMbType`
  rows × reference-pair presence rules, an end-to-end Interpolated
  B-VOP roundtrip (6 bits — dct + fp + forward pair + backward pair),
  partial-presence Forward / Backward B-VOP roundtrips (3 bits each),
  a P-VOP Inter MB roundtrip (4 bits), a zero-bit Inter4V path, the
  S(GMC) `mcsel == 1` `None`-yielding constructor, a truncated-input
  `EndOfStream` error, and a sweep that verifies
  `InterlacedInformation::bit_count()` matches
  `BitReader::bit_position()` across every reachable context under
  a worst-case payload; total crate test count now 740 + 9 doc.
- Round 38 of the clean-room rebuild: §6.2.6 binary-shape
  `transparent_block(j)` elision for the four-MV inter4v branch. The
  §6.2.6 P-VOP macroblock-layer text spells the `derived_mb_type == 2`
  branch as `for (j=0; j<4; j++) if (!transparent_block(j))
  motion_vector("forward")` — when the §6.1.3.4 binary shape leaves an
  8x8 sub-block fully transparent, that sub-block's MV body is omitted
  from the bitstream entirely. Round 37 handled the rectangular case
  (§6.1.3.4 NOTE 2 — every sub-block opaque, four
  `motion_vector("forward")` invocations); round 38 adds
  `decode_p_macroblock_motion_vectors_with_shape(br, derived_mb_type,
  vop_fcode_forward, BinaryShapeBlockOpacity)` so binary-shape VOPs
  elide transparent sub-block MV bodies without consuming bits for
  them. `BinaryShapeBlockOpacity { opaque: [bool; 4] }` encodes the
  §5.2.7 `transparent_block(j)` **negation** per sub-block in Figure
  6-8 raster order (`0 = TL`, `1 = TR`, `2 = BL`, `3 = BR`), with an
  `ALL_OPAQUE` const for the rectangular-shape default and a
  `motion_vector_invocation_count` helper reporting the expected
  number of `motion_vector("forward")` invocations under the mask.
  `BinaryShapeFourMv { deltas: [Option<MotionVectorDelta>; 4] }`
  surfaces the decoded result with `None` for elided slots;
  `iter_present()` walks only the populated `(j, delta)` pairs and
  `to_motion_coding_deltas()` lifts the all-opaque case into the
  existing round-37 `MotionCodingDeltas::FourMv` view so the
  rectangular-shape predictor chain (§7.6.5 + §7.6.3) is unchanged.
  Single-MV / intra `derived_mb_type` values surface `Ok(None)`
  without consuming bits — the §6.2.6 `transparent_block(j)` guard
  only fires inside `if (derived_mb_type == 2)`. Out of scope (later
  rounds): the §6.1.3.4 binary-shape decoder that produces the
  per-sub-block opacity flags, the interlaced `field_prediction`
  second-invocation gate, and the S(GMC)-VOP `mcsel == 1`
  sprite-warping route. 5 new unit tests: all-opaque equivalence with
  round 37's driver (same bit consumption + same per-slot deltas);
  partial-elision case (TL + BL opaque, TR + BR transparent — exactly
  16 bits consumed, two MV pairs at fcode 1, lift-to-FourMv refuses);
  all-transparent zero-bit case (no slot populated); non-Inter4V
  routing guard (Inter / InterQ / Intra / IntraQ all surface `None`
  without consuming bits); `motion_vector_invocation_count` matches
  the populated-flag count across four-mask permutations.
- Round 37 of the clean-room rebuild: §6.2.5
  `motion_coding(mode, type_of_mb)` driver + §6.2.6 P-VOP
  macroblock-level MV-body walker. The §6.2.5 syntax wraps one or four
  invocations of the §6.2.6.2 `motion_vector(mode)` body: the
  unconditional opening call plus a `if (type_of_mb == 2) for (i = 0;
  i < 3; i++) motion_vector(mode)` loop for the `inter4v`-cardinality
  case. `motion_coding(br, mode, type_of_mb, vop_fcode)` decodes the
  body list against the round-7 `decode_motion_vector_delta`
  per-invocation primitive, returning
  `MotionCodingDeltas::{OneMv(MotionVectorDelta), FourMv([MotionVectorDelta; 4])}`.
  `TypeOfMb::{One, Four}` encodes the §6.2.5 `type_of_mb` integer. The
  four `FourMv` slots map to Figure 6-8 raster order (`0 = TL`,
  `1 = TR`, `2 = BL`, `3 = BR`) — the same numbering round 30's
  `MvGrid::FourMv` consumes, so the round-37 output of `motion_coding`
  feeds directly into round-30's `MvGrid::record` without
  re-permutation. `decode_p_macroblock_motion_vectors(br,
  derived_mb_type, vop_fcode_forward)` is the §6.2.6 P-VOP
  macroblock-level MV-body driver: it dispatches on `derived_mb_type`
  per the §6.2.6 syntax — `Inter` / `InterQ` (`derived_mb_type == 0
  || 1`) → `motion_coding("forward", TypeOfMb::One)`; `Inter4V`
  (`derived_mb_type == 2`) → `motion_coding("forward",
  TypeOfMb::Four)`; `Intra` / `IntraQ` (`derived_mb_type == 3 || 4`)
  → no MV body, returns `Ok(None)` without consuming bits. The
  §6.2.6 gates `(derived_mb_type == 0 || derived_mb_type == 1)` and
  `(derived_mb_type == 2)` both exclude the intra branches; the
  caller skips straight to the `for (i = 0; i < block_count; i++)
  block(i)` loop on the `Ok(None)` return. The §7.6.5 predictor add
  stays at the caller layer: each decoded `MotionVectorDelta` pairs
  with its block-position-specific Figure 7-34 predictor via the
  existing round-7 `reconstruct_motion_vector` + round-8
  `predict_motion_vector` + round-30
  `MvGrid::predictor_candidates` chain. The interlaced
  `field_prediction` second-invocation, the S(GMC)-VOP `mcsel == 1`
  sprite-warping route, and the binary-shape `transparent_block(j)`
  elision are intentionally out of scope — rectangular shape
  (§6.1.3.4 NOTE 2) guarantees every 8x8 sub-block is opaque so the
  §6.2.6 transparency guard always fires. 12 new unit tests including
  an Inter / InterQ / Inter4V / Intra / IntraQ exhaustive cross-check
  and an end-to-end `motion_coding → reconstruct_motion_vector`
  composition test that validates the §6.2.6.2 + §7.6.3 + §6.2.5 call
  chain together; total crate test count now 707 + 9 doc.
- Round 36 of the clean-room rebuild: §7.6.1.5 padding of interlaced
  macroblocks — luminance boundary path. New module
  `interlaced_padding`. §7.6.1.5 says verbatim "Macroblocks of
  interlaced VOP (interlaced = 1) are padded according to subclauses
  7.6.1.1 through 7.6.1.3. The vertical padding of the luminance
  component, however, is performed for each field independently. A
  sample outside of a VOP is therefore filled with the value of the
  nearest boundary sample of the same field." The carve-out names only
  the vertical pass, so the §7.6.1.1 horizontal pass keeps its
  frame-mode behaviour and the §7.6.1.2 vertical pass runs per field.
  `interlaced_boundary_padding_luma(decoded, shape)` is the
  end-to-end §7.6.1.5 boundary entry point for a 16×16 luma
  macroblock: §7.6.1.1 frame-mode horizontal pass, then per-field
  §7.6.1.2 vertical pass on the top + bottom field views (rows
  `0, 2, …, 14` / `1, 3, …, 15`), then re-interleave back into a
  16×16 frame. `per_field_vertical_padding_luma(hor_pad, s_prime)`
  exposes the per-field §7.6.1.2 step as a standalone primitive for
  callers that have already run §7.6.1.1 themselves. The returned
  `InterlacedBoundaryOutcome { Padded { top_column_states,
  bottom_column_states }, CompletelyTransparent }` discriminates the
  three cases the §7.6.1.5 routing cares about: at least one field
  filled (each `ColumnState` array reports which per-field columns
  completed); every row fully transparent (the caller routes the
  macroblock to the `2 ^ (bits_per_pixel - 1)` fill via the §7.6.1.3
  `extended_padding` entry points). `LUMA_FIELD_LINES = LUMA_SIDE / 2`
  is the per-field row count (8 of the macroblock's 16 luma rows per
  field). The §7.6.1.5 chrominance "based on fields" carve-out and
  the exterior-MB per-field §7.6.1.3 path are intentionally out of
  scope for this round (the §6.1.3.7.1 +
  `decimate_chroma_shape_interlaced_field` infrastructure shipped in
  round 35 already gives the chroma wrapper its shape-decimation
  prerequisite, and §7.6.1.3 itself is unchanged in the frame-mode
  sense — the carve-out only replaces the §7.6.1.3 mid-grey fallback
  by the `2 ^ (bits_per_pixel - 1)` fill for completely-transparent
  macroblocks, which is the §7.6.1.3 mid-grey case verbatim). 15 new
  unit tests including a cross-check against a manually-composed
  §7.6.1.1 + per-field §7.6.1.2 reassembly and an explicit
  progressive-vs-interlaced divergence on a macroblock whose two
  fields differ in their nearest-neighbour candidates; total crate
  test count now 695 + 9 doc.
- Round 35 of the clean-room rebuild: §6.1.3.7.1 binary-shape decimation
  driving the §7.6.1.4 chrominance-padding shape mask. New module
  `chroma_shape`. §7.6.1.4 says verbatim "Chrominance components are
  padded according to subclauses 7.6.1.1 through 7.6.1.3 for each 8×8
  block. The padding is performed by referring to a shape block
  generated by decimating the shape block of the corresponding
  luminance component. This decimating of the shape block is performed
  by the subsampling process described in subclause 6.1.3.6." The
  3rd-edition section the §7.6.1.4 pointer refers to is §6.1.3.7.1
  ("4:2:0 Format"), which carries the actual rule: "For each 2×2 block
  of the binary alpha plane associated with the luminance plane of the
  bounding rectangle (of the same frame for the progressive and of the
  same field for the interlaced case), the associated pixel value of
  the binary alpha plane associated with the chrominance planes is set
  to 255 if any pixel of said 2×2 block of the binary alpha plane
  associated with the luminance plane equals 255" — a logical OR over
  each 2×2 luma block.
  `decimate_chroma_shape_sample(block: [SamplePresence; 4])` is the
  single-sample primitive (returns `Opaque` iff any of the four input
  samples is opaque). `decimate_chroma_shape::<M, TWO_M>(luma)` is the
  const-generic kernel that walks the `(2M) × (2M)` luma shape and
  emits an `M × M` chroma shape via per-2×2 OR.
  `decimate_chroma_shape_progressive(luma)` is the §7.6.1.4 frame-mode
  entry point pinned to luma 16×16 → chroma 8×8; the output is the
  shape block the §7.6.1.4 padding pipeline routes into
  `horizontal_repetitive_padding_chroma` →
  `vertical_repetitive_padding_chroma` → `extended_padding_chroma`.
  `decimate_chroma_shape_interlaced_field(field)` handles the
  §6.1.3.7.1 interlaced "of the same field" rule — one field's 8×16
  luma shape decimates to a 4×8 chroma field. `CHROMA_FIELD_LINES`
  (= 4) is the per-field chroma row count.
  `stack_interlaced_chroma_shape(top, bottom)` re-interleaves the two
  per-field chroma shape blocks back into a single 8×8 frame block
  (top[0] → row 0, bottom[0] → row 1, …). `split_luma_shape_into_fields(
  luma_frame)` is the matching helper that pulls the two per-field 8×16
  luma blocks out of a 16×16 frame luma shape. The §7.6.1.4 chroma
  padding pipeline now has the shape input it needs; only the §7.6.1.5
  interlaced per-field §7.6.1.1/§7.6.1.2 wrapper remains for the
  §7.6.1 boundary-padding pipeline. 19 new unit tests including the
  spec-rule cross-check over every 2⁴ = 16 mask of a single 2×2 luma
  block; total crate test count now 680 + 9 doc.

- Round 34 of the clean-room rebuild: §7.6.1.3 extended padding — the
  third (and final) pass of the §7.6.1 reference-VOP padding pipeline.
  New module `extended_padding`. After §7.6.1.1 + §7.6.1.2 have left
  every boundary macroblock fully opaque, the §7.6.1.3 pass fills the
  remaining *exterior* macroblocks (every `s[y][x] == 0`) by
  replicating the border row / column of a neighbouring boundary
  macroblock, falling through to the `2^(bits_per_pixel - 1)` mid-grey
  fill when no side-adjacent boundary neighbour exists.
  `extended_padding_macroblock::<N>(neighbours, bits_per_pixel)`
  consumes a `BoundaryNeighbours<N>` (the four optional side-adjacent
  post-§7.6.1.2 boundary macroblocks: `left` / `above` / `right` /
  `below`) and the channel's `bits_per_pixel`, picks the highest-
  priority present neighbour per Figure 7-28 (`3 > 2 > 1 > 0` — left,
  above, right, below in that order), and replicates the matching
  border into the exterior MB: left → rightmost column rightwards;
  above → bottom row downwards; right → leftmost column leftwards;
  below → top row upwards. With no neighbour present, every sample is
  set to `mid_grey_value(bits_per_pixel) = 2^(bits_per_pixel - 1)`
  (128 for the canonical 8-bit case, 512 for 10-bit).
  `extended_padding_luma(neighbours, bits_per_pixel)` /
  `extended_padding_chroma(neighbours, bits_per_pixel)` are the 16×16
  / 8×8 macroblock-level entry points. New public types:
  `ExteriorNeighbourPosition ∈ {Left, Above, Right, Below}` (named to
  not collide with the existing intra-DC `predictor::NeighbourPosition`),
  `BoundaryNeighbours<'a, N>` (the four optional side-adjacent
  post-§7.6.1.2 neighbour grids), `ExteriorPaddingOutcome ∈
  {FromNeighbour(ExteriorNeighbourPosition), MidGrey}` (per-MB outcome
  reporting which §7.6.1.3 branch fired). `BoundaryNeighbours::none()`
  builds an all-absent neighbour set in const context;
  `BoundaryNeighbours::highest_priority_position()` returns the
  Figure 7-28 winner; `ExteriorNeighbourPosition::priority()` exposes
  the numeric priority (`3..=0`) so callers building a custom selector
  don't have to duplicate the table. The §7.6.1.4 chroma shape
  decimation (§6.1.3.6) and the §7.6.1.5 interlaced per-field
  application remain caller-level routing concerns; §7.6.1.3 itself
  is field-independent. 21 new unit tests; total crate test count now
  661 + 9 doc.

- Round 33 of the clean-room rebuild: §7.6.1.2 vertical repetitive
  padding — the second pass of the §7.6.1 reference-VOP padding
  pipeline. New module `vertical_padding` consuming the
  `(hor_pad, s_prime, row_states)` triple produced by §7.6.1.1 and
  filling the remaining transparent samples column-by-column.
  `vertical_repetitive_padding_column::<M>(hor_pad, s_prime, out,
  s_double_prime)` applies the spec's verbatim per-column procedure:
  positions where `s'[y][x] == 1` map straight through; transparent
  positions look up for `y'` (nearest `s'==1` at-or-above `y`) and
  down for `y''` (nearest `s'==1` strictly below `y`), filling with
  `(hor_pad[y'] + hor_pad[y'']) // 2` (§3.4 truncation toward zero
  via `i32::div_euclid`) when both exist, or with the single
  available neighbour when only one exists. Columns with no
  `s'==1` sample fall through to the column-guard and report
  `ColumnState::FullyTransparent` so the caller can route the
  macroblock to §7.6.1.3 extended padding.
  `vertical_repetitive_padding_luma(hor_pad, s_prime, row_states)` /
  `vertical_repetitive_padding_chroma(hor_pad, s_prime, row_states)`
  are the 16×16 / 8×8 macroblock-level entry points that loop the
  per-column routine over the macroblock side and return the
  `(hv_pad, s_double_prime, column_states)` triple. New public type:
  `ColumnState ∈ {FullyFilled, FullyTransparent}` (the per-column
  §7.6.1.2 outcome). The §7.6.1.2 fill sentinel `s''[y][x]` surfaces
  directly via the `s_double_prime` output. The §7.6.1.3 extended
  padding for exterior macroblocks, §7.6.1.4 chroma shape decimation,
  and §7.6.1.5 interlaced per-field padding remain later-round work.
  17 new unit tests; total crate test count now 640 + 9 doc.

- Round 32 of the clean-room rebuild: §7.6.1.1 horizontal repetitive
  padding — the first pass of the §7.6.1 reference-VOP padding
  pipeline. New module `sample_padding` filling the transparent
  samples of a boundary macroblock by replicating the VOP-boundary
  samples of the same row.
  `horizontal_repetitive_padding_row::<N>(decoded, shape, out,
  s_prime)` applies the spec's verbatim per-row procedure to any row
  size: for each transparent sample, look left for `x'` (nearest
  opaque at-or-before `x`) and right for `x''` (nearest opaque
  strictly after `x`); both exist → fill with `(d[x'] + d[x'']) // 2`
  (§3.4 truncation toward zero via `i32::div_euclid`); only one side
  exists → replicate that boundary sample; neither exists → the
  row-guard reports `ShapeRowState::FullyTransparent` for the
  §7.6.1.2 vertical pass to handle later.
  `horizontal_repetitive_padding_luma(decoded, shape)` /
  `horizontal_repetitive_padding_chroma(decoded, shape)` are the 16×16
  / 8×8 macroblock-level entry points (matching the §6.1.3.4 luma side
  and the §7.6.1.4 chroma side) that return the
  `(hor_pad, s_prime, row_states)` triple. New public types:
  `SamplePresence ∈ {Opaque, Transparent}` (the per-sample `s[y][x]`
  flag) and `ShapeRowState ∈ {FullyFilled, FullyTransparent}` (the
  per-row §7.6.1.1 row-guard outcome). Public constants `LUMA_SIDE =
  16` and `CHROMA_SIDE = 8`. The §7.6.1.1 fill sentinel `s'[y][x]`
  (initialised to 0 then flipped to 1 on any fill) surfaces directly
  via the `s_prime` output so the §7.6.1.2 vertical pass can pick up
  per-sample row state. The §7.6.1.2 vertical pass, §7.6.1.3 extended
  padding for exterior macroblocks, §7.6.1.4 chroma shape decimation,
  and §7.6.1.5 interlaced per-field padding remain later-round work.
  15 new unit tests; total crate test count now 623 + 9 doc.

- Round 31 of the clean-room rebuild: §7.3 VOP reconstruction — the
  per-pixel `d[y][x] = p[y][x] + f[y][x]` step-2 sum plus the step-3
  `[0, 2^bits_per_pixel - 1]` display-range saturation that closes the
  decoder pipeline. New module `reconstruct`. `clip_display_sample(
  value, bits_per_pixel)` is the per-sample §7.3 step-3 primitive (the
  three-branch clip "`2^bpp - 1` when `d > 2^bpp - 1`, `d` when
  `0 <= d <= 2^bpp - 1`, `0` when `d < 0`").
  `reconstruct_inter_block_8x8(prediction, residual, bits_per_pixel)`
  (plus the `_into` buffer-out variant) applies §7.3 step-2 + step-3 to
  one 8×8 inter block — `out[y][x] = clip(prediction[y][x] +
  residual[y][x], 0, 2^bpp - 1)`. `reconstruct_intra_block_8x8(sample,
  bits_per_pixel)` covers the §7.3 step-1 intra branch (`d = f`, then
  the §7.3 step-3 clip). `reconstruct_inter_macroblock(prediction,
  residual, bits_per_pixel)` and `reconstruct_intra_macroblock(sample,
  bits_per_pixel)` (plus the `_into` variant for the inter path)
  operate at the 4:2:0 macroblock granularity, consuming the existing
  16×16-luma + 8×8-chroma `InterMacroblock` / `IntraMacroblock`
  residual / sample shapes produced by `decode_inter_macroblock` /
  `decode_intra_macroblock` and the new `InterPredictionMacroblock`
  shape that holds the `p[y][x]` plane outputs from the §7.6
  half-sample / quarter-sample / B-VOP prediction modules.
  `InterPredictionMacroblock::zero()` constructs the all-zero
  prediction macroblock for the §7.6.9.6 / boundary-substitution
  fallback case. `ReconstructedMacroblock` carries the `d[y][x]`
  output planes in the §7.3 step-3 display range `[0, 2^bpp - 1]`,
  ready to be blitted into the VOP frame buffer. The luma / Cb / Cr
  planes are processed independently — a §7.3 step-3 clip on one
  plane does not affect the others. The §6.3.3 `not_8_bit` /
  `bits_per_pixel != 8` path is honoured by every entry point. Public
  constants `BLOCK_SIDE = 8`, `MACROBLOCK_LUMA_SIDE = 16`,
  `MACROBLOCK_CHROMA_SIDE = 8`. 21 new unit tests; total crate test
  count now 608 + 9 doc.
- Round 30 of the clean-room rebuild: §7.6.5 / Figure 7-34 spatial
  motion-vector predictor candidate gathering. New module
  `mv_predictor_grid` providing `MvGrid::new(mb_rows, mb_cols)` and
  per-macroblock `record_one_mv` / `record_four_mv` / `record_absent`
  setters (plus generic `record(mb_row, mb_col, MbMvRecord)`). The
  `predictor_candidates(mb_row, mb_col, block_index)` query (also
  available as the free function `gather_mv_predictor_candidates`)
  resolves the three Figure 7-34 spatial positions for the current
  8×8 luminance block (Figure 6-8 numbering: `0 = TL`, `1 = TR`,
  `2 = BL`, `3 = BR`) into a `[Option<MotionVector>; 3]` triple ready
  to feed directly into `predict_motion_vector`. New public types:
  `MbMv ∈ {Absent, OneMv(MotionVector), FourMv([MotionVector; 4])}`,
  `MbMvRecord { content, transparent: [bool; 4] }`, `MvGrid`,
  `MvGridError`. The §7.6.5 boundary-substitution rule for
  neighbours outside the current VOP / video packet / GOB is handled
  by `MvGrid::record_absent` on the boundary MBs. Per-luma-block
  transparency within an otherwise-opaque macroblock is handled by
  the four-element `MbMvRecord::transparent` mask. The four
  block-position cases follow the in-repo ASCII transcription of
  Figure 7-34 in
  `docs/video/mpeg4-visual/figure-7-34-mv-predictor-layout.md`. 22
  new unit tests + 1 doctest; total crate test count now 587 + 9 doc.
- Round 29 of the clean-room rebuild: §7.6.9.5.3 second-paragraph +
  §7.6.9.4 chrominance motion-compensation plane for B-VOPs.
  `generate_b_vop_chroma_prediction(forward_chroma_ref,
  backward_chroma_ref, forward_chroma_mv, backward_chroma_mv,
  chroma_mb_origin_x, chroma_mb_origin_y, vop_rounding_type,
  prediction_mode)` (plus the `_into` buffer-out variant) fills one
  8×8 chroma prediction block (Cb or Cr — the caller passes the
  matching anchor-VOP plane and runs it once per component) by
  applying §7.6.2.1 half-sample bilinear interpolation to the supplied
  chroma MV against the forward and / or backward chroma reference
  plane, then averages pixel-by-pixel via
  `Pi[i][j] = (Pf[i][j] + Pb[i][j] + 1) >> 1` for `Bidirectional` and
  `Direct` modes (the §7.6.9.5.3 last paragraph rule). Chroma uses
  half-pel bilinear regardless of the VOL `quarter_sample` flag — the
  round-27 `chroma_mv_from_luma_blocks` already reduced the K luma MVs
  to a single half-pel chroma MV per direction, and §7.6.5 paragraph
  above Table 7-13 fixes §7.6.2.1 bilinear (not §7.6.2.2 FIR) for
  chroma. New public constants `CHROMA_BLOCK_SIDE = 8` and
  `CHROMA_BLOCK_PIXELS = 64`. 12 new unit tests; total crate test
  count now 565 + 8 doc.
- Round 28 of the clean-room rebuild: §7.6.1.6 vector padding technique.
  New `src/vector_padding.rs`.
  `pad_macroblock_vectors(vectors, transparencies, mode)` applies the
  per-macroblock §7.6.1.6 procedure to a `[MotionVector; 4]` of luma
  block MVs in Figure 6-8 / §6.1.3.4 raster order
  (`0 = TL, 1 = TR, 2 = BL, 3 = BR`).
  `MacroblockPaddingMode::AllZero` covers the §7.6.1.6 top-level branch
  for INTRA-coded macroblocks and P-VOP `skipped` macroblocks — all
  four `vectors[i]` are overwritten with `(0, 0)` regardless of
  `transparencies[i]`. `MacroblockPaddingMode::PerBlock` runs the
  per-block fallback branch: each `BlockTransparency::Transparent` block
  walks the precedence-ordered table
  `FALLBACK_CHAIN = [[1,2,3], [0,3,2], [3,0,1], [2,1,0]]` (the verbatim
  transcription of the §7.6.1.6 nested `?:` expressions: horizontal
  partner first, then diagonal / vertical in the alternating spec
  order) until the first `Opaque` partner is found, and copies that
  partner's MV in. Partner MVs come from a pre-padding snapshot so
  the fallback chain always reads the §7.6.1.6 *input* vectors, not
  the in-place-updated outputs of a prior iteration (the spec
  pseudo-code reads `MVx[j]` on every `?:` RHS — these must be the
  pre-padding values). `VectorPaddingError::AllTransparent` rejects a
  fully-transparent macroblock under `PerBlock` per the §7.6.1.6
  opening sentence ("applied to ... the transparent blocks within a
  *non-transparent* macroblock"). The output feeds three downstream
  consumers: the `K` luma MVs that flow into
  `chroma_mv_from_luma_blocks` (§7.6.5 luma → chroma derivation),
  the spatial MV predictor `MV1 / MV2 / MV3` candidate gathering
  (§7.6.5), and the temporally-next anchor VOP's co-located MVs that
  `direct_mode_motion_vector` linearly scales (§7.6.9.5 B-VOP direct
  mode). Per the §7.6.1.6 closing paragraph, S(GMC) `mcsel == 1`
  blocks must have the §7.8.7.3 averaged MV substituted into
  `vectors[i]` before invocation — this module accepts the
  post-substitution vectors and treats them as ordinary block MVs.
  Test coverage: 21 new unit tests (fallback-table shape sanity,
  AllZero branch overrides decoded MVs + ignores transparency
  pattern, PerBlock identity for all-opaque, each block as the
  single transparent slot, 2nd-choice fallback cases, 3rd-choice
  fallback cases, snapshot semantics verification, AllTransparent
  rejection without modifying vectors, negative-MV propagation,
  error display contains the spec clause) + 1 doctest + 1
  lib-level Error round-trip. Total crate test count now 553 + 8 doc.
- Round 27 of the clean-room rebuild: §7.6.5 chrominance motion-vector
  derivation `MVDCHR` from `K ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}` luminance sub-block
  motion vectors (4:2:0 rectangular VOP). New `src/chroma_mv.rs`.
  `chroma_mv_from_luma_blocks(&[MotionVector])` sums the K luma MVs
  component-wise, divides by `2 * K` via floor (`i32::div_euclid`),
  and applies the §7.6.5 fractional rounding by indexing one of four
  newly-transcribed tables based on `K`:
  * `TABLE_7_13` (K = 1, "fourth sample resolution", 4 entries
    `[0, 1, 1, 1]`);
  * `TABLE_7_12` (K = 2, "eighth sample resolution", 8 entries
    `[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]`);
  * `TABLE_7_11` (K = 3, "twelfth sample resolution", 12 entries
    `[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]`);
  * `TABLE_7_10` (K = 4, "sixteenth sample resolution", 16 entries
    `[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]`).
  The table output `2` represents a carry into the next integer
  chroma-pel (one full chroma-pel = 2 half-sample offsets). The
  residue is pre-scaled by 2 so that the half-sample-grid sum
  indexes the table's `1/(4 * K)`-sample grid. Floor division
  (`div_euclid` / `rem_euclid`) keeps the residue non-negative for
  negative MV inputs so the lookup is well-defined across the sign
  range, matching the convention established by
  `quarter_sample::reduce_qpel_to_half_pel_chroma`. The §7.6.5
  "in quarter sample mode the vectors are divided by 2 before
  summation" pre-divide rule is left to the caller (the spec text
  doesn't pin the rounding for that pre-divide step); the module
  documents the suggested componentwise
  `reduce_qpel_to_half_pel_chroma` wrapping until the docs
  collaborator confirms the rule. `ChromaMvError::InvalidBlockCount`
  rejects `K = 0` and `K > 4`. Test coverage: 24 new unit tests
  (table-shape checks, K = 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 worked examples
  including the §7.6.5 worked spec example `(4, 4) * 4 → (2, 2)`,
  negative-input floor-division symmetry, error display) + 1
  doctest. Total crate test count now 532 + 7 doc.
- Round 26 of the clean-room rebuild: §7.6.9.5.3 B-VOP luminance
  prediction-block generation. New `src/bvop_prediction.rs`.
  `generate_b_vop_luma_prediction(forward_ref, backward_ref, mvs,
  mb_origin_x, mb_origin_y, vop_rounding_type, mode, prediction_mode)`
  builds the 16×16 luminance prediction macroblock by interpolating
  four Figure-6-8-ordered 8×8 sub-blocks via the §7.6.2.1 (half-pel)
  or §7.6.2.2 (quarter-pel) primitives and applying the §7.6.9.4 /
  §7.6.9.5.3 rule `Pi[i][j] = (Pf[i][j] + Pb[i][j] + 1) >> 1`.
  `BVopPredictionMode::{ForwardOnly, BackwardOnly, Bidirectional,
  Direct}` selects the §7.6.9 mode: the three non-Direct modes
  replicate the single bitstream MV across all four sub-blocks
  (§7.6.9.2 / §7.6.9.3 / §7.6.9.4 carry one MV per macroblock);
  Direct mode (§7.6.9.5) consumes the four per-sub-block
  `MVF[i]` / `MVB[i]` pairs produced by
  `direct_mode_motion_vector`. `BVopSampleMode::{HalfPel,
  QuarterPel { bits_per_pixel }}` plumbs the VOL `quarter_sample`
  flag through to the right interpolation primitive.
  `average_bidirectional_into(a, b, out)` exposes the §7.6.9.4
  averaging primitive directly (arithmetic in `u16` so the `+ 1`
  cannot overflow even at `u8::MAX` in both operands). Per the
  §7.6.9.5.3 explicit note, four 8×8 sub-blocks with the same MV
  in quarter-sample mode do NOT collapse to one 16×16 fetch —
  this module preserves the property by interpolating one sub-block
  at a time. The output is the §7.3 step-1 `p[y][x]` prediction;
  the §7.3 step-2 residual add and step-3 `[0, 2^bpp - 1]` clip
  remain the caller's responsibility (deliberately separated to
  keep each layer testable). 17 new unit tests + 1 doctest; total
  crate test count now 508 + 6 doc.

### Added

- Round 25 of the clean-room rebuild: §7.6.9.5.2 direct-mode forward
  and backward motion-vector derivation for B-VOPs.
  `direct_mode_motion_vector(co_located, mvd, trb, trd, units)`
  linearly scales the co-located anchor-VOP MV by the §7.6.7
  temporal-reference ratio and applies the delta vector via the
  §7.6.9.5.2 formulas
  `MVF = (TRB * MV) / TRD + MVD` and
  `MVB = (MVD == 0) ? ((TRB - TRD) * MV) / TRD : MVF - MV`,
  with the division `/` taken as §3.4 truncation-toward-zero
  (matching Rust's `i32::Div` on signed operands).
  `DirectCoLocatedMv::TransparentOrAbsent` substitutes
  `MV = (0, 0)` per the §7.6.9.5.1 final-sentence fallback so direct
  mode stays enabled when the reference slot is transparent or
  out-of-bounds; the delta MVD passes through unchanged into both
  `MVF` and `MVB`. `DirectMvUnits::QpelMvToHalfPel` covers the
  §7.6.9.5.2 fourth-paragraph quarter-to-half-pel reduction (MV
  halved component-wise plus Table 7-13 rounding) for the
  `quarter_sample == 1` / half-pel-`MVD` mismatch case;
  `direct_mode_reduce_qpel_to_half_pel(mv)` exposes the reduction
  directly so callers can pre-apply it once per macroblock when the
  reference is four block-vectors. `DirectMvError::{InvalidTrd,
  TrbOutOfRange}` enforces the §7.6.7 preconditions `TRD > 0` and
  `0 <= TRB <= TRD`. The returned `(MVF, MVB)` pair is intentionally
  not clipped to the Table 7-9 `[low:high]` range — the §7.6.9.5.2
  linear scaling factor `TRB / TRD ∈ [0, 1]` already keeps the
  magnitude bounded relative to the co-located `MV`, and the
  §7.6.9.5.3 prediction-block generator that follows consumes the
  algebraic value directly. The reference-grid lookup (which
  co-located MB sits at the current MB position in the temporally
  next anchor VOP, plus the §7.6.1.6 vector padding step) remains
  the caller's responsibility. 17 new unit tests cover: canonical
  splits (`TRB == TRD`, `TRB == 0`, both zero-deltas), the §3.4
  truncation-toward-zero division for both positive and negative
  dividends, the transparent-with-zero-delta skipped-MB zero pair
  (§7.6.9.6), the per-component branch independence (`dx != 0`
  takes the subtract branch while `dy == 0` takes the scaled
  formula), the QpelMvToHalfPel reduction matching
  `quarter_sample::reduce_qpel_to_half_pel_chroma` componentwise,
  and the end-to-end Direct-mode MVD round-trip with `f_code == 1`
  per §7.6.3's closing paragraph. Crate test count now 491 + 5 doc.
- Round 24 of the clean-room rebuild: §7.6.2.2 quarter-sample mode
  interpolation (Figures 7-31 and 7-32) for the luminance component
  of P-, S(GMC)-, and B-VOPs, plus Table 7-13 chroma motion-vector
  reduction. New `src/quarter_sample.rs`. `split_quarter_pel(mv)`
  decomposes a §7.6.3 quarter-pel motion-vector component into
  `(integer_part, qfrac ∈ 0..=3)` via arithmetic shift by 2;
  negative MVs floor toward `-∞` so the fractional pair is always
  non-negative (e.g. `split_quarter_pel(-1) == (-1, 3)`).
  `fir_8tap_clip(samples, rounding_control, bits_per_pixel)`
  evaluates the §7.6.2.2.1 8-tap symmetric FIR
  `(C[4], C[3], C[2], C[1], C[1], C[2], C[3], C[4]) / 256` with
  `C = [160, -48, 24, -8]`, the `+ 128 - rc` rounding offset, and
  the `[0, 2^bpp - 1]` clip. `half_pel_b` / `half_pel_c` /
  `half_pel_d` are the horizontal / vertical / diagonal half-pel
  building blocks; `half_pel_d` cascades the horizontal FIR through
  a vertical FIR with each intermediate value independently
  clipped (matching the spec's two-step description).
  `interpolate_quarter_pixel(vop, int_x, int_y, qfrac_x, qfrac_y,
  rounding_control, bits_per_pixel)` resolves any of the 16
  Figure 7-32 sub-pel positions (`a`, `e_{-1}`, `b_{-1}`,
  `f_{-1}`, `g`, `h`, `i`, `j`, `c`, `k`, `d`, `l`, `m`, `n`, `o`,
  `p`) via the §7.6.2.2.2 bilinear `(X + Y + 1 - rc) / 2` blends,
  with `k` and `l` themselves applying the 8-tap FIR vertically to
  the `e` / `f` quarter-pel columns.
  `interpolate_block_qpel(vop, mv_x, mv_y, origin_x, origin_y,
  block_w, block_h, vop_rounding_type, bits_per_pixel)` and
  `interpolate_block_qpel_into(...)` fill a luminance prediction
  block from a single quarter-pel motion vector, applying §7.6.4
  edge clamping per fetch via `ReferenceVop::fetch_clamped`.
  `reduce_qpel_to_half_pel_chroma(c)` applies Table 7-13's
  `{0, 1, 1, 1}` fractional mapping to convert a quarter-pel luma
  component into a half-pel chrominance component (the integer
  part doubles; non-zero quarter fractions round toward the +0.5
  chroma-pel position; negative inputs floor via the same
  arithmetic-shift convention as `split_quarter_pel`). §7.6.1
  padding for arbitrarily shaped VOPs and interlaced field-based
  motion compensation remain later-round work; the caller still
  hands `ReferenceVop` a fully reconstructed and padded reference
  plane. 29 new unit tests + 3 doctests cover the Table 7-13
  fractional + integer rows, the §7.6.2.2.1 FIR sum and clipping
  (both polarities of saturation), the half-pel helpers'
  consistency with the quarter-pel resolver, the integer / half /
  full pel sub-pel selection, §7.6.4 edge-clamp behaviour at
  negative origins, sub-pel rounding-control ties, the block-fill
  flat-reference property, and a horizontal-gradient monotonicity
  property. Total crate test count now 472 + 5 doc.

- Round 23 of the clean-room rebuild: §7.6.2.1 half-sample bilinear
  interpolation (Figure 7-29). New `src/half_sample.rs` evaluates the
  four §7.6.2.1 per-pixel formulas
  `a = A`, `b = (A + B + 1 - rc) / 2`, `c = (A + C + 1 - rc) / 2`,
  `d = (A + B + C + D + 2 - rc) / 4` (integer division;
  `rc ∈ {0, 1}` from `vop_rounding_type`).
  `interpolate_pixel(A, B, C, D, half_x, half_y, rounding_control)`
  is the per-pixel kernel; `split_half_pel(mv)` decomposes a §7.6.3
  half-pel motion-vector component into `(integer_part,
  half_pel_bit)` via arithmetic shift (negative MVs round toward
  `-∞`, matching §3.4 division). `ReferenceVop` wraps a raster-order
  `&[u8]` reference plane (with optional row-stride) and exposes
  `fetch_clamped(x, y)` for the §7.6.4 last-full-pel edge clamp
  (per-component clipping, matching Figure 7-33).
  `fetch_clamped_sample(vop, int_x, int_y, half_x, half_y, rc)`
  composes the up-to-four neighbour fetches for one sub-pel sample,
  lazily skipping `B` / `C` / `D` when the corresponding half-pel
  bit is `0`. `interpolate_block(vop, mv_x, mv_y, origin_x,
  origin_y, block_w, block_h, vop_rounding_type)` and
  `interpolate_block_into(...)` fill an entire `block_w × block_h`
  prediction block from one motion vector. The §7.6.6 OBMC
  `FnMut(ObmcMv, i, j) -> u8` sample-provider closure now has a
  concrete reference-plane implementation callers can wire up.
  §7.6.2.2 quarter-sample mode (the 8-tap FIR + bilinear quarter-pel
  step) and §7.6.1 reference-VOP padding remain later-round work.
  25 new unit tests + 2 new doctests; total crate test count now
  443 + 2 doc.

- Round 22 of the clean-room rebuild: §7.6.6 Overlapped Motion
  Compensation (OBMC). `obmc_predict_block(current_mv, neighbours,
  cfg, sample)` composes the §7.6.6 luminance equation
  `p(i, j) = (q(i,j)*H0(i,j) + r(i,j)*H1(i,j) + s(i,j)*H2(i,j) + 4)
  // 8` over one 8×8 prediction block. `OBMC_H0` / `OBMC_H1` /
  `OBMC_H2` transcribe Figures 7-35 / 7-36 / 7-37 of ISO/IEC
  14496-2:2004 as `[[u8; 8]; 8]` constants; a unit test verifies
  `H0 + H1 + H2 = 8` in every cell, so flat reference samples
  (`q == r == s == C`) reproduce `C` exactly. The §7.6.6 per-pixel
  remote-MV selection — MV1 from `above` for `j < 4` and from
  `below` for `j >= 4`; MV2 from `left` for `i < 4` and from `right`
  for `i >= 4` — is implemented on `ObmcNeighbourhood`. The four
  §7.6.6 substitution rules surface as
  `RemoteBlockKind::{Inter, NotCoded, Intra, Absent}` (not-coded →
  zero MV; intra-coded → current MV; absent-at-border → current MV)
  with the rule-4 "below-MB" override carried by
  `ObmcNeighbourhood::current_block_at_mb_bottom`. `ObmcConfig::
  disabled()` short-circuits to the bare MV0-only prediction
  (one sample fetch per pixel, `p = q`) for the
  `obmc_disable == 1` and S(GMC)-VOP mcsel-boundary cases of the
  §7.6.6 opening paragraph. The reference-frame sample fetch
  (§7.6.2 bilinear half-sample interpolation) stays in the caller
  via the `FnMut(ObmcMv, usize, usize) -> u8` sample-provider
  closure. 13 new unit tests; total crate test count now 418.

- Round 21 of the clean-room rebuild: §6.2.7 `block(i)` driver for
  inter macroblocks. `decode_inter_block(br, i, coded, ctx,
  quant_matrix)` runs one inter block's §6.2.7 syntax — `if
  (pattern_code[i]) while (!last) DCT coefficient`, no intra-DC
  prologue, no §7.4.3 spatial predictor — through the §7.4.x chain:
  `decode_ac_events(TcoefTable::Inter)` → `events_to_qfs(events,
  None)` (no DC) → §7.4.2 zigzag `inverse_scan` (§7.4.2 "non-intra
  blocks → zigzag") → §7.4.3.4 `saturate_block` → §7.4.4 inverse
  quant with `macroblock_intra == false` (method 1 with `W[1]` when
  `quant_type == 1`, else method 2) → §7.4.5 + Annex A `idct_8x8`
  saturating to `[-2^bpp, 2^bpp - 1]`. The output is the §7.3 step-2
  residual `f[y][x]`, not clipped to `[0, 2^bpp - 1]`. When
  `coded == false` no bits are consumed and the residual is the
  all-zero block. `decode_inter_macroblock` walks Figure 6-8 over
  six blocks for any `DerivedMbType ∈ {Inter, InterQ, Inter4V}` and
  assembles a 16×16 luma + 8×8 Cb / 8×8 Cr `InterMacroblock` of
  signed residuals. `not_coded` short-circuits to
  `BlockAssemblyError::NotCoded`; non-inter `mb_type` returns
  `BlockAssemblyError::NotInter`. `nonintra_quant_matrix(vol)`
  resolves `W[1]` from the VOL header (loaded `nonintra_quant_mat`
  de-zigzagged when present, else the §6.3.3 default non-intra
  matrix).

- Round 20 of the clean-room rebuild: §6.2.2 / §6.3.2.3 / §6.3.2.4
  `VisualObject()` header tightening. `parse_visual_object_header`
  now returns a typed `VisualObjectHeader { visual_object_verid,
  visual_object_priority, is_visual_object_identifier,
  visual_object_type, video_signal_type }` instead of the bare
  `visual_object_type` byte. `visual_object_verid` defaults to `1`
  (per §6.3.2.3 — "When this field does not exist, the value … is
  `0001`") and `visual_object_priority` defaults to `1` (highest
  legal value; `0` is reserved per §6.3.2.3) when
  `is_visual_object_identifier == 0`. The §6.2.2 `video_signal_type()`
  body now decodes when the leading flag bit is set: 3-bit
  `video_format` (Table 6-7), 1-bit `video_range`, and the optional
  8 + 8 + 8 `colour_primaries` / `transfer_characteristics` /
  `matrix_coefficients` triple (Tables 6-8 / 6-9 / 6-10), surfaced via
  `VideoSignalType` + `ColourDescription`.
  `ColourDescription::default_when_absent()` returns the §6.3.2.4
  BT.709 fallback (`1, 1, 1`) for callers that need the absent-block
  default. The 1-bit `video_signal_type` flag is consumed
  unconditionally so the bit reader stays aligned with downstream
  start-code search.

- Round 19 of the clean-room rebuild: §7.8.7.3 S(GMC)-VOP
  averaged-vector substitution. `averaged_motion_vector(pel_mvs_x,
  pel_mvs_y, pel_denominator, quarter_sample, vop_fcode)` returns the
  candidate motion-vector predictor for `mcsel == 1` macroblocks (which
  have no own block motion vector — pel-wise motion vectors arrive
  from sprite warping per §7.8.5). Sums `Nb = 256` luminance pel-wise
  MVs, divides by 256 with the spec's `//` operator (§3.4 — round to
  nearest integer, ties away from zero), quantises to half-pel or
  quarter-pel units according to `quarter_sample` per the §7.8.7.3 bin
  table, and clips to the Table 7-9 `[low:high]` range for the
  supplied `vop_fcode`. `pel_denominator` is the caller's pel-wise
  fixed-point grid (`1` integer-pel, `2` half-pel, `4` quarter-pel,
  `16` for the sixteenth-pel grid used by §7.8.5 sub-pel warping, …);
  any positive value yields well-defined integer arithmetic via the
  spec's `//` rounding. `AMV_PIXEL_COUNT` exposes the fixed `Nb = 256`.

- Round 18 of the clean-room rebuild: §6.2.5 `video_packet_header`
  decode (rectangular shape). New `src/video_packet.rs`.
  `parse_video_packet_header(br, &VideoPacketContext)` consumes the
  §5.2.5 `next_resync_marker()` stuffing run (`0 1*` to byte
  alignment), the 17..=23-bit `resync_marker` per §6.3.3 length
  formula (17 for I, `16 + fcode` for P / S(GMC),
  `max(16 + max(fcode_fwd, fcode_bwd), 17)` for B), the Table 6-27
  `macroblock_number` (`ceil(log2(total_mbs))` bits, 1..=14), the
  `quant_precision`-bit `quant_scale` (1..=2^precision - 1; 0
  rejected as `ForbiddenQuantScale`), and the `header_extension_code`.
  When the extension bit is set the rectangular extension body —
  `modulo_time_base`, `vop_time_increment`, `vop_coding_type`,
  `intra_dc_vlc_thr`, plus optional `vop_fcode_forward` (not I) and
  `vop_fcode_backward` (B only) — is decoded into the corresponding
  optional fields of `VideoPacketHeader`.
  `macroblock_number_bit_width(total)` evaluates Table 6-27.
  `total_macroblocks(width, height)` exposes the input expression.
  `resync_marker_length(coding_type, fcode_fwd, fcode_bwd)` evaluates
  the §6.3.3 length formula. `consume_next_resync_marker(br)` runs the
  §5.2.5 stuffing; `probe_resync_marker(br, …)` non-destructively
  peeks for the marker at a byte-aligned position. Non-rectangular
  and binary-only shape, sprite-GMC trajectory inside the extension,
  newpred-enable `vop_id` extension, and reduced-resolution VOP
  extension are typed-rejected via
  `VideoPacketParseError::UnsupportedBranch`. 33 new tests cover
  Table 6-27 boundaries (every row at lo + hi), the §6.3.3 length
  formula across I / P / S / B with all relevant fcode ranges, the
  §5.2.5 stuffing positive path + reader-aligned and partial-byte
  cases + first-bit and tail-bit rejections, `probe_resync_marker`
  positive / non-aligned-reader / P-vs-I disambiguation, and the
  full parser path on I / P / B with and without the extension body
  plus every rejection arm (resync-disabled, non-rectangular,
  bad-quant-precision, missing-marker, mb-number out of range,
  zero quant_scale, zero fcode in extension, sprite-GMC + newpred +
  reduced-resolution extension rejections).

- Round 17 of the clean-room rebuild: §7.4.1.3 Type 4 escape — the
  `short_video_header == 1` AC-EVENT escape coding.
  `decode_ac_event_short_video_header(br, table_kind)` decodes one
  §7.4.1.2 `DCT coefficient` EVENT under the short-video-header
  discipline. The common Tcoef VLC + sign bit (Table B.16 for intra,
  Table B.17 for inter) is unchanged from `decode_ac_event`, but the
  §7.4.1.3 Type 1..=3 escapes are replaced by Type 4: `ESC`
  (`0000 011`) + 1-bit LAST + 6-bit RUN + 8-bit signed
  two's-complement LEVEL (Table B.18 a / c), no marker bits per
  §7.4.1.3 paragraph 4. The reserved LEVEL values `0000 0000` (= 0)
  and `1000 0000` (= -128) are rejected as
  `TextureParseError::ReservedEscapeLevel`.
  `decode_ac_events_short_video_header(br, table_kind)` runs the
  §6.2.7 `while (!last) DCT coefficient` loop against the Type-4 path.
  14 new tests cover the common-path passthrough (intra positive /
  inter negative), the Type-4 escape positive / negative LEVELs, the
  max-legal-positive (`+127`) and min-legal-negative (`-127`)
  boundaries, the full RUN range (`63`), both reserved LEVEL
  rejections (`0` and `-128`), the inline LAST flag, the loop
  terminator behaviour (LAST=1), the loop's truncation handling
  (empty reader → `Truncated`), the absence of marker bits (LEVEL
  bits that would be a marker in Type 3 are now LEVEL bits), and
  truncation mid-LEVEL byte.
- Round 16 of the clean-room rebuild: §7.4.3 / Figure 7-5 predictor
  candidate gathering. New `src/neighbour.rs` module owns the cross-block
  walk that resolves, for each block-to-decode `X`, the three Figure 7-5
  neighbours `A` (left), `B` (above-left), and `C` (above) from a per-VOP
  grid of already-decoded blocks. `IntraBlockGrid::new(mb_rows, mb_cols)`
  allocates one `(2*mb_rows) × (2*mb_cols)` luma sub-grid plus two
  `mb_rows × mb_cols` Cb / Cr sub-grids of `Option<BlockNeighbour>`;
  every cell starts `None` and is filled by `record(mb_row, mb_col, i,
  Some(BlockNeighbour))` as blocks are decoded.
  `predictors_for(mb_row, mb_col, i, bits_per_pixel, quantiser_scale)`
  walks Figure 7-5 against the recorded grid and returns the
  `BlockPredictors` argument `decode_intra_block` already consumes.
  Neighbours outside the sub-grid, recorded `None`, or recorded with
  `is_intra == false` fall back to the §7.4.3.1 default `F[0][0] =
  2^(bits_per_pixel + 2)` (and the §7.4.3.3 AC prediction coefficients
  are zeroed via `None` `first_row` / `first_column`). `BlockNeighbour`
  carries the inverse-quantised DC, the quantiser scale `Qp`, the first
  row (`QF[0][1..=7]`) and first column (`QF[1..=7][0]`) of quantised AC
  coefficients, and an `is_intra` flag; `BlockNeighbour::from_qf(&qf,
  dc, qp)` builds it from a reconstructed intra block.
  `block_grid_position(mb_row, mb_col, i)` exposes the static Figure 6-8
  mapping from `(mb_row, mb_col, i)` to component sub-grid coordinates
  (luma at `(2*mb_row + top_bit, 2*mb_col + left_bit)`, Cb / Cr each at
  `(mb_row, mb_col)`). 19 tests cover the in-MB neighbour cases (block 1
  picks block 0 as `A`; block 2 picks block 0 as `C`; block 3 sees all
  three of blocks 2 / 0 / 1 as `A` / `B` / `C`), the cross-MB cases
  (block 0 of the next column / row / inner MB picks the appropriate
  block of the left / above / diagonal MB), the chroma sub-grid isolation
  (Cb and Cr do not leak into each other or into the luma sub-grid), the
  non-intra-neighbour fallback (`is_intra == false` triggers the
  §7.4.3.1 default), the explicit `None` record (e.g. across a
  video-packet boundary), and a deterministic 2×2 MB raster-walk
  round-trip. The §7.4.3 spatial DC/AC predictor math (rounds 12 / 15)
  consumes the resulting `BlockPredictors` unchanged.
- Round 15 of the clean-room rebuild: §6.2.7 `block(i)` macroblock-level
  texture assembly for intra I-VOP macroblocks. New `src/block.rs`
  module drives the §7.4.x pipeline built in rounds 9..14 end-to-end on
  a per-macroblock basis. `decode_intra_block(br, i, coded, ctx,
  predictors, quant_matrix)` runs one block's §6.2.7 `block(i)` syntax
  (the always-present differential intra-DC, then the
  `if (pattern_code[i]) while (!last) DCT coefficient` AC loop) through
  the full chain: `decode_intra_dc` + `decode_ac_events` →
  `events_to_qfs` → §7.4.2 `inverse_scan` (scan pattern from
  `select_scan_type`) → §7.4.3 spatial DC/AC predictor (`predict_intra_dc`
  / `predict_intra_ac_row` / `predict_intra_ac_column`, gated by
  `ac_pred_flag`) → §7.4.3.4 `saturate_block` → §7.4.4 inverse
  quantisation (method 1 with the `W[0]` intra matrix when
  `quant_type == 1`, else method 2) → §7.4.5 + Annex A `idct_8x8` →
  §6.3.2 final clip to the display range `[0, 2^bpp - 1]`.
  `decode_intra_macroblock(br, header, ctx, predictors, quant_matrix)`
  walks the §6.1.3.9 / Figure 6-8 4:2:0 block order (0,1 / 2,3
  luminance; 4 Cb; 5 Cr) and assembles the reconstructed 16×16
  luminance + 8×8 Cb / 8×8 Cr `IntraMacroblock`. `pattern_code(cbpy,
  cbpc)` derives the six §6.2.7 per-block coded flags from the
  macroblock header. `BlockPredictors::outside(bpp, qs)` supplies the
  §7.4.3.1 / §7.4.3.3 "neighbour outside the VOP" predictor state
  (default DC `2^(bpp+2)`, zero AC prediction). The §6.3.3 default
  intra / non-intra quantisation matrices (`DEFAULT_INTRA_QUANT_MATRIX`
  / `DEFAULT_NONINTRA_QUANT_MATRIX`) and `de_zigzag` / `intra_quant_matrix`
  resolve the method-1 `W[0]` matrix. Tests cover the `pattern_code`
  bit-to-block mapping, `de_zigzag` placement, a DC-only block
  reconstructing flat (method 2 exact 128, method 1 within ±1 LSB of
  the §7.4.4.5 mismatch-control perturbation), a known +1 DC
  differential reconstructing to a flat 130, a coded Type-3-escape AC
  EVENT breaking block flatness, full six-block macroblock assembly
  (flat luma 128 + flat chroma 128), and `NotCoded` / `NotIntra`
  rejections.
- Round 14 of the clean-room rebuild: §7.4.5 + Annex A inverse
  discrete cosine transform. New `src/idct.rs` module evaluating
  Annex A.1's orthonormal 8×8 IDCT
  `f(x, y) = (2/N) Σ_u Σ_v C(u) C(v) F(u, v) cos((2x+1)uπ/(2N))
  cos((2y+1)vπ/(2N))` with `N = 8`, `C(0) = 1/√2`, `C(k) = 1` for
  `k ≠ 0`. Implemented as a separable two-pass 1-D IDCT
  (`f(x) = √(2/N) Σ_u C(u) F(u) cos((2x+1)uπ/(2N))`) against a
  lazily-initialised `f64` cosine-table `COS[u][x] =
  cos((2x+1)uπ/16)`. The final value is rounded to nearest (§4.1)
  and saturated to `[-2^bits_per_pixel, 2^bits_per_pixel - 1]` per
  the §7.4.5 closing sentence. `idct_8x8(coefficients,
  bits_per_pixel)` is the entry point; `idct_saturation_bounds(bpp)`
  / `saturate_idct_sample(value, bpp)` surface the §7.4.5 clamp.
  Tests cover: DC-only block (`F[0][0] = 256` → `f[y][x] = 32`),
  flat-block round-trip via a forward-DCT helper (recon ≤ ±1 LSB),
  deterministic pseudo-random block round-trip (recon ≤ ±1 LSB per
  IEEE 1180-1990 §3.3 with Annex A.1's normative deviations),
  cross-validation against the §7.4.4 intra-DC inverse-quant path
  (`QF = 4` at `qs = 5` → `F''[0][0] = 40` → `f[y][x] = 5`), zero
  block at every supported `bpp` (4 / 8 / 10 / 12), both saturation
  polarities, the §7.4.5 cosine-table sanity check at `cos(0) = 1`
  / `cos(π/4) = √2/2`, the `F[0][*]` single-row `y`-uniform
  property, and the highest-frequency `F[7][7]` checkerboard sign
  pattern. 17 new unit tests, 297 total.
- Round 13 of the clean-room rebuild: §7.4.4 inverse quantisation —
  Figure 7-7's full `QF[v][u] -> F''[v][u] -> F'[v][u] -> F[v][u]`
  pipeline for one 8×8 DCT block. New `src/inverse_quant.rs` module.
  `inverse_quant_intra_dc(qf00, component, quantiser_scale,
  short_video_header)` evaluates the §7.4.4.1.1 intra DC formula
  `F''[0][0] = dc_scaler * QF[0][0]` — Table 7-1 (via
  `predictor::dc_scaler`) when `short_video_header == 0`, the fixed
  `dc_scaler = 8` of §7.4.4.3 / §7.4.1.1 otherwise.
  `inverse_quant_method1_coef(qf, w, qs, intra)` /
  `inverse_quant_method1(qf, w, ctx)` implement the §7.4.4.1.2 first
  inverse-quantisation method — intra `(QF * W[0] * qs * 2) / 16`,
  non-intra `((2*QF + Sign(QF)) * W[1] * qs) / 16` — and the whole-block
  driver fuses §7.4.4.4 saturation to
  `[-2^(bpp+3), 2^(bpp+3) - 1]` plus §7.4.4.5 mismatch control
  (sum-parity gated LSB toggle on `F[7][7]`, implemented via XOR per
  the §7.4.4.5 NOTE 1) following the §7.4.4.6 summary pseudo-code.
  `inverse_quant_method2_coef(qf, qs)` /
  `inverse_quant_method2(qf, ctx)` implement the §7.4.4.2.1 second
  method (`(2*|QF|+1)*qs` for odd `qs`, the same minus one for even
  `qs`, sign re-applied via the §7.4.4.2.1 trailing sentence) and
  honour §7.4.4.2's instruction to keep using §7.4.4.1.1 for the
  intra-DC coefficient. `saturation_bounds(bpp)` /
  `saturate_fprime(value, bpp)` expose the §7.4.4.4 clamp.
  `InverseQuantContext { macroblock_intra, component, quantiser_scale,
  bits_per_pixel, short_video_header }` bundles the per-block scalars.
  Method-1 / method-2 path arithmetic, both signs, both
  `quantiser_scale` parities, both saturation polarities, the
  short-video-header DC path, and the parity-driven mismatch toggle
  are each covered by dedicated tests (+30 unit tests; 280 round-1..13
  tests pass total).
- Round 12 of the clean-room rebuild: §7.4.3 spatial DC / AC predictor
  for intra macroblocks (the `short_video_header == 0` path). New
  `src/predictor.rs` module. `default_neighbour_dc(bits_per_pixel)`
  returns the §7.4.3.1 fallback `F[0][0] = 2^(bits_per_pixel + 2)` for
  neighbours outside the VOP / video packet or in a non-intra
  macroblock. `dc_scaler(component, quantiser_scale)` evaluates
  Table 7-1's piece-wise linear non-linear DC scaler — with separate
  Type 1 (luminance) and Type 2 (chrominance) formulas across the
  `1..=4` / `5..=8` / `9..=24` / `>= 25` quantiser bands (chrominance
  merges the `5..=8` and `9..=24` columns under `(qs + 13) / 2`).
  `select_dc_direction(fa, fb, fc)` applies the §7.4.3.1 rule
  `|FA-FB| < |FB-FC|` → predict from `C` (above), else from `A`
  (left). `predict_intra_dc(pqfx_dc, dir, fa, fc, dc_scaler_x)`
  evaluates the §7.4.3.2 reconstruction
  `QFX[0][0] = PQFX[0][0] + chosen / dc_scaler`.
  `predict_intra_ac_row` / `predict_intra_ac_column` apply the
  §7.4.3.3 first-row / first-column scaled-by-`QpC/QpX` (or
  `QpA/QpX`) add; if the predictor neighbour is `None` (outside the
  VOP / video packet) the call returns `PQFX` unchanged per §7.4.3.3
  ("all the prediction coefficients of that block are assumed to be
  zero"). `saturate_qf` / `saturate_block` apply the §7.4.3.4
  `[-2048, 2047]` clamp.
- `NeighbourPosition { Left, AboveLeft, Above }` and `NeighbourBlock
  { dc, qp, first_row, first_column }` value types surfacing the
  Figure 7-5 three-neighbour layout to callers that will gather
  neighbours from a block grid in a future round.
- 31 round-12 unit tests covering: `2^(bpp+2)` at `bpp` 4 / 8 / 12 (the
  §6.3.3 valid range) and the panic guard at `bpp = 31`; every
  Table 7-1 boundary value for luminance (`qs` 1..=4 / 5..=8 / 9..=24
  / 25..=31) and chrominance (`qs` 1..=4 / 5..=24 / 25..=31, with the
  truncated `(qs+13)/2`); luminance monotonicity across the full
  5-bit quantiser range; the three direction-selection paths
  (horizontal gradient → from C, vertical gradient → from A, equal
  diffs → from A by the strict-`<` rule, default-neighbour-all-equal
  → from A); `predict_intra_dc` from-above and from-left, with
  truncation-toward-zero on both signs; `predict_intra_ac_column`
  and `predict_intra_ac_row` with equal Qp ratios, doubled Qp,
  truncating Qp ratios, and missing-neighbour pass-through; saturation
  at the `[-2048, 2047]` boundary and beyond (including `i32::MIN/MAX`);
  full DC-predictor integration on a luminance block (qs=5) and a
  chrominance block (qs=7).
- Re-export: `predict_intra_dc`, `predict_intra_ac_row`,
  `predict_intra_ac_column`, `saturate_qf`, `saturate_block`,
  `dc_scaler`, `default_neighbour_dc`, `select_dc_direction`,
  `NeighbourBlock`, `NeighbourPosition` at the crate root. The
  pre-existing `DcPredictionDirection` enum is shared with `scan` via
  a `pub use`.

- Round 11 of the clean-room rebuild: §7.4.2 inverse scan — the
  conversion of the one-dimensional decoded coefficient stream
  `QFS[64]` into the two-dimensional `PQF[v][u]` 8×8 block under one
  of three scan patterns. The three scan tables from Figure 7-4 —
  (a) Alternate-Horizontal, (b) Alternate-Vertical, (c) Zigzag — are
  transcribed verbatim into `src/scan.rs` as `[[u8; 8]; 8]` grids
  (`ALT_HORIZONTAL` / `ALT_VERTICAL` / `ZIGZAG`).
  `inverse_scan(qfs, scan_type)` applies the §7.4.2
  `PQF[inv_scan_v[scan_type][n]][inv_scan_u[scan_type][n]] = QFS[n]`
  loop. `events_to_qfs(events, intra_dc)` expands a §7.4.1.2 AC EVENT
  sequence (with an optional §7.4.1.1 intra-DC value at scan position
  0) into the dense `[i32; 64]` array; defensively returns
  `InverseScanError::Overflow { position }` if a malformed stream
  would write past coefficient 63. `events_to_pqf(events, intra_dc,
  scan_type)` is the one-call combination.
  `select_scan_type(is_intra, ac_pred_flag, dc_direction)` encodes the
  §7.4.2 per-block scan-selection rule: non-intra or `ac_pred_flag ==
  0` → zigzag; intra + AC-pred + DC predictor from above (C) →
  alternate-vertical; intra + AC-pred + DC predictor from left (A) →
  alternate-horizontal.
- `ScanType { AlternateHorizontal, AlternateVertical, Zigzag }`,
  `DcPredictionDirection { FromLeft, FromAbove }`, and
  `InverseScanError { Overflow { position } }` value types; the new
  crate-level `Error::InverseScan` variant + `From` conversion.
- 23 round-11 unit tests: each of the three scan grids is a
  permutation of `0..=63`; zigzag starts in the canonical JPEG order
  and ends with `63` at `(7, 7)`; alt-vertical's first column walks
  `0,1,2,3,10,11,12,13` and alt-horizontal's first row matches it
  (the two scans are each other's transpose, also asserted
  cell-by-cell); `inverse_scan` round-trips a DC-only block, the
  first six zigzag positions, the alt-vertical first column, the
  alt-horizontal first row, and `QFS[63]` → `PQF[7][7]` for all three
  scans; `events_to_qfs` with intra-DC (`run`-skips + LEVEL at the
  right position) and without (AC EVENT walks from position 0);
  overflow rejection both from position 0 and post-intra-DC; the
  one-call `events_to_pqf` end-to-end; the four cases of
  `select_scan_type` (intra without AC-pred = zigzag, non-intra always
  zigzag, intra + AC-pred + above/left); and `Display` for
  `InverseScanError`. Plus 1 round-11 `Error::InverseScan` lib-test
  round-trip.

- Round 10 of the clean-room rebuild: §7.4.1.2 AC-coefficient (EVENT)
  decode — the `while (!last) DCT coefficient` loop of the §6.2.7
  `block(i)` texture syntax, for the `short_video_header == 0` /
  `reversible_vlc == 0` path. New `decode_ac_event(br, table_kind)`
  decodes one `(LAST, RUN, LEVEL)` EVENT: the common case is a
  Table B.16 (intra) / Table B.17 (inter) Tcoef VLC selected by the new
  `TcoefTable` argument plus a trailing sign bit (`0` positive, `1`
  negative). The §7.4.1.3 escape prefix `0000 011` selects one of the
  first three escape modes — Type 1 (`ESC 0` + Tcoef VLC; `LEVEL =
  sign * (abs(LEVEL) + LMAX(LAST, RUN))` via Tables B.19 (intra) /
  B.20 (inter)), Type 2 (`ESC 10` + Tcoef VLC; `RUN = RUN +
  RMAX(LAST, abs(LEVEL)) + 1` via Tables B.21 (intra) / B.22 (inter)),
  and Type 3 (`ESC 11` + fixed-length `LAST(1) RUN(6) marker_bit
  LEVEL(12) marker_bit`; the 12-bit LEVEL is signed two's-complement
  with `0` and `-2048` reserved per Table B.18 b). New
  `decode_ac_events(br, table_kind)` runs the full §6.2.7 loop,
  returning every EVENT up to and including the `LAST == 1` terminator.
- `TcoefTable { Intra, Inter }` selector and `AcEvent { last, run,
  level }` value type, re-exported at the crate root.
- The 102-entry Table B.16 (intra) and Table B.17 (inter) Tcoef EVENT
  VLC tables in `src/tcoef_tables.rs`, `include!`d into `texture.rs`;
  generated verbatim from the spec tables (each `(code_bits, code_len,
  last, run, level)` without the trailing sign bit).
- `TextureParseError::{InvalidTcoef { window }, EscapeMarkerBitMissing,
  ReservedEscapeLevel}` variants with `Display`, threaded through the
  existing `Error::Texture` conversion.
- 23 round-10 unit tests: both Tcoef tables 102 entries, prefix-free,
  no duplicates, and disjoint from the escape prefix; intra/inter
  common-case EVENTs (with the intra-vs-inter `110s` divergence) and
  sign handling; the `LAST == 1` terminator and the `decode_ac_events`
  loop; escape Type 1 (LMAX add, both signs), Type 2 (RMAX run
  expansion, intra & inter), Type 3 (positive/negative/min-legal
  LEVEL, reserved `0` / `-2048` rejection, missing-marker rejection);
  invalid-Tcoef and truncated-stream rejection; full round-trips over
  every Table B.16 and Table B.17 entry; and LMAX/RMAX spot-checks.

- Round 9 of the clean-room rebuild: §7.4.1.1 intra-DC texture-
  coefficient decode — the first stage of the §6.2.7 `block(i)`
  texture syntax. New `decode_intra_dc(br, component)` reads
  `dct_dc_size_luminance` (Table B.13, for `block(i)` index `i < 4`)
  or `dct_dc_size_chrominance` (Table B.14, for `i >= 4`) selected by
  the `DcComponent` argument, the `size`-bit `dct_dc_differential`
  additional code (read only when `size != 0`), and the trailing
  `marker_bit` (consumed and validated only when `size > 8`, per
  Table B.15 NOTE 2's start-code-emulation guard). It applies the
  Table B.15 sign-decode (`half_range = 2^(size-1)`; an additional
  code `c >= half_range` → `+c`, else `(c + 1) - 2*half_range`) and
  returns the signed *differential* DC value as
  `IntraDcDifferential { size, differential }`. The result is the
  block's differential DC; the §7.4.3.1 spatial predictor add
  (`QF[0] = dct_dc_pred + differential`) and the §7.4.1.2 AC
  coefficient decode are later-round work.
- `DcComponent { Luminance, Chrominance }` with
  `DcComponent::from_block_index(i)` (the §6.2.7 `i < 4` luminance /
  `i >= 4` chrominance split for 4:2:0); `IntraDcDifferential { size,
  differential }` value type.
- `TextureParseError { Truncated, InvalidDcSize { window },
  MarkerBitMissing }` + `Display` + `Error` + `From<BitReaderError>`,
  surfaced through the new crate-level `Error::Texture` variant +
  `From` conversion.
- 23 round-9 unit tests: both `dct_dc_size` tables prefix-free and
  covering sizes 0..=12; Table B.15 sign-decode for sizes 1/2/3 and
  the size-8 boundaries (`-255`/`-128`/`128`/`255`); `size == 0` → 0;
  `from_block_index` luma/chroma split; luminance & chrominance
  size-0 (no additional code), size-1 positive/negative, size-2,
  size-3; size-9 luminance positive with marker-bit consumption;
  size-9 chrominance negative (`-511`) with marker; marker-bit-zero
  rejection; invalid `dct_dc_size` prefix rejection; truncated empty
  reader; truncated mid-additional-code; full round-trip of every
  Table B.13 row (all-ones additional → `+(2^size - 1)`) and every
  Table B.14 row (all-zeros additional → `1 - 2^size`); and `Display`
  coverage for the three error variants. Plus one crate-level
  `Error::Texture` round-trip test. Total unit test count rises from
  149 to 173.
- Round 8 of the clean-room rebuild: §7.6.5 median-filter
  motion-vector predictor for progressive P-/S(GMC)-VOPs. New
  `predict_motion_vector([Option<MotionVector>; 3])` takes the three
  spatial candidate predictors (`MV1`/`MV2`/`MV3`, where `None` marks
  an invalid neighbour — a transparent macroblock/block, or a
  neighbour outside the current VOP / video packet / GOB, all "treated
  as transparent" per the §7.6.5 note), applies the four §7.6.5
  validity decision rules (a valid candidate keeps its block vector;
  exactly one invalid → set to zero; exactly two invalid → both set to
  the one remaining valid candidate; all three invalid → zero), and
  computes the predictor `Px = Median(MV1x, MV2x, MV3x)` /
  `Py = Median(MV1y, MV2y, MV3y)`. The §7.6.5 worked example
  (`MV1=(-2,3)`, `MV2=(1,5)`, `MV3=(-1,7)` → `Px=-1`, `Py=5`) fixes
  `Median(a, b, c)` as the middle of three integers — the §4.1
  arithmetic-operator clause does not list `Median`. The resolved
  `(Px, Py)` feeds straight into the round-7
  `reconstruct_motion_vector`. Internal `median3` and
  `resolve_candidates` helpers back the public entry point.
- Gathering the candidate predictors from the spatial neighbourhood
  (Figure 7-34 block positions, the four-MV vs single-MV cases, and
  the S(GMC)-VOP `mcsel == '1'` averaged-vector substitution of
  §7.8.7.3) is deliberately left to a later round: Figure 7-34 is a
  diagram with no textual position list in the spec text, so this
  round resolves and medians candidates the caller has already
  gathered.
- 7 round-8 unit tests: `median3` middle-of-three (spec worked-example
  components, permutation-invariance, duplicates, negative-spanning);
  the full §7.6.5 worked example via `predict_motion_vector`; rule 1
  (all three valid → component-wise median); rule 2 (one invalid → set
  to zero); rule 3 (two invalid → both take the third, asserted for
  each of the three valid slots); rule 4 (all invalid → zero); and an
  end-to-end `predict_motion_vector` → `reconstruct_motion_vector`
  pipeline. Total unit test count rises from 142 to 149.
- Round 7 of the clean-room rebuild: §6.2.6.2 `motion_vector(mode)`
  bitstream decode plus the §7.6.3 general motion-vector decoding
  process. New `decode_motion_vector_delta(br, mode, vop_fcode)` walks
  one `motion_vector("forward" / "backward" / "direct")` body — a pair
  of Table B.12 `mv_data` VLCs (65 codes, "vector differences" −16…+16
  in half-pel steps; the on-wire value is the doubled integer −32…+32
  per the §7.6.3 note), each followed by an `r_size`-bit
  (`r_size = vop_fcode - 1`) `*_mv_residual` when
  `vop_fcode != 1 && mv_data != 0`. It reconstructs the differential
  vector `(MVDx, MVDy)` via the §7.6.3 recurrence
  (`f = 1 << r_size`, `MVD = (Abs(mv_data)-1)*f + residual + 1`, sign
  from `mv_data`) and returns a `MotionVectorDelta { dx, dy }`. The
  `"direct"` branch reads only the two `mv_data` VLCs (no residuals).
- `reconstruct_motion_vector(delta, px, py, vop_fcode)` — adds a
  caller-supplied predictor `(Px, Py)` and applies the §7.6.3 /
  Table 7-9 modulo wrap into `[low:high]` (`low = -32*f`,
  `high = 32*f - 1`, `range = 64*f`), yielding the final
  `MotionVector { x, y }`.
- `MvMode { Direct, Forward, Backward }` selector mirroring the
  §6.2.6.2 `mode` argument; `MotionVectorDelta { dx, dy }` and
  `MotionVector { x, y }` value types.
- `MotionParseError { Truncated, InvalidMvData { window },
  InvalidFcode(u8) }` + `Display` + `Error` + `From<BitReaderError>`,
  surfaced through the crate-level `Error::Motion` variant.
- The motion-vector path is exercised by a full Table B.12 round-trip,
  a prefix-free-table assertion (all 65 codes mutually
  non-prefixing), a Table 7-9 bounds check, residual-gating cases for
  `vop_fcode` 1 vs 2, and modulo-wrap boundary tests. Total unit test
  count rises from 119 to 142.
- Round 6 of the clean-room rebuild: §6.2.6 B-VOP macroblock-header
  prefix bit-walk for rectangular VOL shape with 4:2:0 chroma. New
  `parse_b_vop_mb_header(br, vol, vop_coding_type, table)` consumes
  `modb` (Table B.3 — `1` / `01` / `00`), `mb_type` (Table B.4 for
  non-scalable B-VOPs or Table B.5 for the spatially-scalable
  enhancement layer with `ref_select_code == 00`), the 6-bit `cbpb`
  (block_count == 6 per §6.2.6 NOTE), and the 1-or-2-bit `dbquant`
  (Table 6-33: `0` → 0, `10` → -2, `11` → +2) into a typed
  `BVopMbHeader { modb, mb_type, cbpb, mvdf_present, mvdb_present,
  dbquant_delta }`. Motion-vector bodies are deliberately left
  unread; the bit reader is positioned at the start of the
  `interlaced_information()` / `motion_vector("…")` block per the
  spec syntax.
- `BVopMbType` enum (`Direct`, `Forward`, `Backward`, `Interpolated`)
  with `has_forward_mv`, `has_backward_mv`, `may_have_dbquant`
  predicates. `Direct` is reachable only via Table B.4; Table B.5
  has no direct row per §7.9.2.8.3.
- `BMbTypeTable { B4, B5 }` selector — callers pick the active
  table from the VOL/VOP-level `ref_select_code && scalability`
  predicate from §6.2.6.
- `default_b_mb_type(scalable: bool) -> BVopMbType` — implements the
  §6.3.6 default-type rule: scalable enhancement layer → "forward
  mc + Q", otherwise → "direct". Used when `modb == '1'` and
  therefore `mb_type` is absent from the bitstream.
- `parse_dbquant(br)` standalone helper returning `(consumed_bits,
  delta)` for the 1-or-2-bit Table 6-33 VLC.
- `BVopMbParseError { Truncated, InvalidModb { window },
  InvalidMbType { window }, NotBVop(VopCodingType),
  UnsupportedShape(u8), UnsupportedChromaFormat(u8) }` + `Display`
  + `Error` + `From<BitReaderError>`.
- `Error::BVopMacroblock(BVopMbParseError)` variant + `From`
  conversion on the crate-level error surface.
- 27 round-6 unit tests: `modb` Table B.3 full round-trip;
  Table 6-33 `dbquant` full round-trip; `BVopMbType` predicates;
  default-type per scalability; `modb == 1` default direct vs
  scalable default forward; `modb == 01` mb_type-present cases;
  `modb == 00` cbpb-zero (no dbquant); `modb == 00` cbpb-non-zero
  (dbquant present); Direct row never carries dbquant even when
  cbpb is non-zero (§6.2.6 syntax `mb_type != '1'` gate); full
  round-trip of every Table B.4 row; full round-trip of every
  Table B.5 row; Table B.5 `1` decodes to Forward (not Direct);
  dbquant = 0 (single 0 bit) and dbquant = -2 (`10`) round-trip;
  rejection of non-B VOP coding types; rejection of non-rectangular
  shape; rejection of non-4:2:0 chroma format (when explicit via
  `vol_control`); 4:2:0 acceptance via explicit control block;
  truncated buffer; truncated mid-mb_type; truncated mid-dbquant;
  invalid mb_type window in Table B.5; `Display` coverage for all
  six error variants; bit-reader position correctness past dbquant;
  `BVopMbParseError -> Error` conversion + `Display` contains
  "B-VOP macroblock parse error".

- Round 5 of the clean-room rebuild: §6.2.6 macroblock-layer
  header bit-walk for I-VOPs and P-VOPs with rectangular VOL shape
  and 4 non-transparent blocks. New `parse_macroblock_header(br,
  vop_coding_type, vol)` consumes `not_coded` (P-VOP only — Table B.1
  shows it absent on I-VOP), `mcbpc` (Tables B.6 / B.7), the intra-MB
  `ac_pred_flag`, `cbpy` (Table B.8, 4 non-transparent blocks), and
  `dquant` (Table 6-32) into a typed `MacroblockHeader { not_coded,
  mb_type, cbpc, ac_pred_flag, cbpy, dquant_delta }`. Stuffing
  macroblocks (mcbpc → "Stuffing") are consumed transparently per
  §6.2.6; the function returns the first non-stuffing header.
- `MacroblockHeader::SKIPPED` const for the not_coded=1 P-VOP case
  (§6.3.6 — decoder treats as inter with zero MV and no DCT data).
- `DerivedMbType` enum (`Inter`, `InterQ`, `Inter4V`, `Intra`,
  `IntraQ`) matching the Table B.1 derived_mb_type integers, with
  `as_u8`, `is_intra`, `has_dquant` predicates.
- `dquant_value(code: u8) -> i8` expanding Table 6-32 (`00 → -1`,
  `01 → -2`, `10 → +1`, `11 → +2`).
- `MacroblockParseError { Truncated, InvalidMcbpc { window },
  InvalidCbpy { window }, UnsupportedVopKind(VopCodingType),
  UnsupportedShape(u8) }` + `Display` + `Error` + `From<BitReaderError>`.
- `Error::Macroblock(MacroblockParseError)` variant + `From`
  conversion on the crate-level error surface.
- 23 round-5 unit tests: Table 6-32 dquant round-trip;
  `DerivedMbType` predicates; minimal I-VOP intra MB; I-VOP intra+q
  with dquant; P-VOP not_coded skip; P-VOP inter MB (no dquant);
  P-VOP inter+q with dquant -2; P-VOP intra with ac_pred; P-VOP
  inter4v; I-VOP stuffing skip; P-VOP stuffing skip; B-VOP /
  S-VOP rejection; non-rectangular-shape rejection; invalid mcbpc
  prefix; invalid cbpy prefix; truncated; Display coverage for all
  five error variants; `MacroblockHeader::SKIPPED` defaults;
  full round-trip of every Table B.6 / B.7 non-stuffing entry; full
  round-trip of every Table B.8 entry (intra + inter columns);
  `MacroblockParseError -> Error` conversion + Display contains
  "macroblock parse error".

- Round 4 of the clean-room rebuild: §6.2.3.3 `quant_type == 1`
  quantiser-matrix load body decode. After `quant_type = 1`, the
  parser reads `load_intra_quant_mat` (1 bit) and, if set, the
  `8*[2-64]` zigzag-ordered 8-bit `intra_quant_mat` list terminated
  by an optional 0 sentinel (with the remaining entries set to the
  last non-zero value per §6.3.3); same for `load_nonintra_quant_mat`
  / `nonintra_quant_mat`. The grayscale follow-on
  (`load_*_quant_mat_grayscale`) is gated on
  `video_object_layer_shape == "grayscale"`, which the parser
  rejects upfront.
- `VolHeader::intra_quant_mat: Option<[u8; 64]>` and
  `VolHeader::nonintra_quant_mat: Option<[u8; 64]>`. `Some(_)` only
  when the corresponding `load_*_quant_mat` flag was set; entries
  are stored in zigzag scan order with the 0-sentinel run-length
  expansion already applied.
- `VolParseError::EmptyQuantMatrix(&'static str)` for the malformed
  case where the first transmitted matrix byte is 0 (the `8*[2-64]`
  syntax requires at least two values; a leading 0 implies zero
  transmitted).
- 9 round-4 unit tests: full 64-entry intra matrix with no sentinel;
  two-entry intra with zero-sentinel run-length fill; both intra +
  nonintra loaded simultaneously; intra-only / nonintra-only mixed
  with the un-loaded sibling staying `None`; leading-0 intra and
  leading-0 nonintra rejection; minimal two-entry list; full-64 no
  sentinel verifies the tail is *not* re-filled; direct truncation
  of the `parse_quant_matrix` helper. `vol_error_branch_displays`
  was extended to assert the new error's `Display` text.
- Round 3 of the clean-room rebuild: promotion of the ISO/IEC 14496-2
  §6.2.3 trailing VOL fields onto `VolHeader` — `interlaced`,
  `obmc_disable`, `sprite_enable` (Table 6-19), `not_8_bit`,
  `quant_precision`, `bits_per_pixel`, `quant_type`,
  `quarter_sample` (when verid != 1), `complexity_estimation_disable`,
  `resync_marker_disable`, `data_partitioned`, `reversible_vlc`,
  `newpred_enable` (verid != 1), `reduced_resolution_vop_enable`
  (verid != 1), and `scalability`.
- `SpriteEnable` enum (`NotUsed` / `Static` / `Gmc` / `Reserved`)
  matching the Table 6-19 one-bit (verid == 1) and two-bit (verid !=
  1) on-wire encodings.
- `VolParseError::BadQuantPrecision(u8)` for `not_8_bit` paths that
  advertise a `quant_precision` outside §6.3.3's 3..=9 range.
- `VolParseError::UnsupportedBranch(&'static str)` for the
  recognised-but-out-of-scope §6.2.3 branches (`sprite_enable static`
  / `GMC` / reserved body, `quant_type` load matrix bodies, custom
  complexity-estimation header, `newpred_enable` body).
- `VopContext::from_vol(&vol)` convenience constructor that pulls the
  promoted fields out of `VolHeader` so callers no longer hand-stitch
  context.
- `VopHeader::from_vol(&vol, payload)` one-call entry point that
  composes `parse_video_object_plane_header(payload,
  vol.time_increment_resolution, VopContext::from_vol(&vol))`.
- 16 round-3 unit tests: minimal VOL trailing-block parse;
  `interlaced` / `obmc_disable` / `sprite_enable` carry-back;
  `not_8_bit` + `quant_precision` + `bits_per_pixel` decode;
  out-of-range `quant_precision` rejection; sprite-static rejection;
  verid==2 two-bit `sprite_enable` (NotUsed + GMC + Reserved cases);
  complexity-estimation-header branch rejection;
  `data_partitioned` + `reversible_vlc` carry-back; `scalability`
  carry-back; `quant_type` load-matrix rejection; `quant_type` no-load
  success; `VolParseError::UnsupportedBranch` + `BadQuantPrecision`
  display; `VopContext::from_vol` projection; `VopHeader::from_vol`
  on a minimal I-VOP; `VopHeader::from_vol` propagates the VOL's
  `vop_time_increment_resolution`.
- Round 2 of the clean-room rebuild: structural parsers for the
  ISO/IEC 14496-2 §6.2.4 Group-of-VOP and §6.2.5 Video Object Plane
  headers, stopping cleanly at the macroblock layer.
- Public `parse_group_of_vop_header` + `parse_video_object_plane_header`
  entry points, with typed `GovHeader { time_code, closed_gov,
  broken_link }`, `VopHeader { coding_type, modulo_time_base,
  time_increment, composed_ticks, coded, rounding_type,
  intra_dc_vlc_thr, quant, fcode_fwd, fcode_bwd }`, `VopCodingType`
  (Table 6-24), and `TimeCode` (Table 6-23).
- `VopContext` wrapper carrying the VOL-side bits the §6.2.5 syntax
  table depends on (`quant_precision`, `interlaced`, `sprite_gmc`,
  `sprite_static`, `scalability`, `newpred_enable`,
  `reduced_resolution_vop_enable`, `complexity_estimation_disable`).
- Forbidden `vop_fcode == 0` rejection (§6.3.5).
- Out-of-scope branch rejection (`scalability` / `newpred_enable` /
  `reduced_resolution_vop_enable` / sprite / complexity-estimation
  header) with typed `VopParseError::UnsupportedBranch`.
- 24 round-2 unit tests covering: VOP start-code constant
  (`0x000001B6`); GOV start-code constant (`0x000001B3`);
  `VopCodingType::from_bits` Table-6-24 mapping;
  `vop_time_increment_bits` resolution-1 special case; minimal I-VOP
  parse; `modulo_time_base` accumulation; P-VOP `fcode_forward`; P-VOP
  `fcode_forward == 0` rejection; B-VOP both fcodes; B-VOP
  `fcode_backward == 0` rejection; `vop_coded == 0` early return with
  default fields; missing VOP start code; marker-bit violation;
  scalability / newpred / bad-quant-precision rejection;
  `quant_precision == 9` 9-bit quant; interlaced consumes
  `top_field_first` + `alt_vert_scan`; GOV time-code parse; GOV missing
  start code / missing marker; `VopParseError` display +
  `VopParseError -> VolParseError` conversion + `Error::Vop` round
  trip.
- Round 1 of the clean-room rebuild: structural parsers for the
  ISO/IEC 14496-2 §6.2 configuration headers
  (`VisualObjectSequence`, `VisualObject`, `VideoObjectLayer`).
- Public `parse_visual_object_sequence_header`,
  `parse_visual_object_header`, and `parse_video_object_layer`
  entry points.
- Typed `VolHeader { profile_level, width, height,
  time_increment_resolution, aspect_ratio, vol_control, … }`,
  `AspectRatio`, `VolControlParameters`, `VbvParameters`.
- MSB-first `BitReader` with `read_bits`, `read_bool`, `next_bits`,
  `align_to_byte`, `skip_bits`.
- Start-code constants for `VS` (`0x000001B0`), `VS_END`
  (`0x000001B1`), `VO` (`0x000001B5`), `VO_LAYER` range
  (`0x00000120`..=`0x0000012F`), and `VO` range
  (`0x00000100`..=`0x0000011F`).
- 20 round-1 unit tests covering bit reader, marker-bit failures,
  forbidden aspect ratio, extended-PAR, `vol_control_parameters` +
  VBV decode, fixed-VOP rate, Studio Profile rejection, FGS branch
  awareness, non-rectangular shape rejection, and
  `vop_time_increment_bits` width formula.

### Changed

- Round 20: `parse_visual_object_header` return type changed from
  `Result<u8, VolParseError>` to `Result<VisualObjectHeader,
  VolParseError>`. Callers reading the old `visual_object_type` byte
  should use the new struct's `.visual_object_type` field.

### Notes

- Macroblock decoding (motion vectors, DCT coefficients, MB headers)
  is not in scope this round; the round-2 parser stops cleanly at the
  start of `motion_shape_texture()`.
- Studio Profiles (`profile_and_level_indication` 0xE1..=0xE8) and
  Fine-Granularity-Scalable VOL headers are recognised and rejected
  with typed errors rather than silently mis-parsed.
- Sprite, scalability, newpred, reduced-resolution, and complexity-
  estimation VOP branches are explicitly rejected via
  `VopParseError::UnsupportedBranch` rather than mis-aligning the
  bitstream.

### Erased

- Prior master history was force-erased on **2026-05-18** under
  Hat-3 cold enforcement of the workspace clean-room policy
  (`docs/IMPLEMENTOR_ROUND.md`).

### Reset

- Crate reduced to a minimal `oxideav_core::register!` stub. Every
  public API returns `Error::NotImplemented`. The crates.io version
  (`0.1.5`) is preserved on the new master to avoid breaking
  downstream version pins; the published versions on crates.io will
  be yanked by the maintainer.
