# Conformance-fixture provenance

Every fixture pairs an MPEG-4 Visual **elementary stream** (`.m4v`,
start-code-delimited §6.2.1 units — no container) with the raw
`yuv420p` **reference decode** of that stream in display order
(`.yuv`). Both sides were produced by **black-box invocations of the
`ffmpeg` binary** (version 8.1) used opaquely as an encode/decode
oracle; no external implementation source was consulted.

## Reference decodes (`.yuv`)

Every expected output is generated with the **default integer simple
IDCT** (`ff_simple_idct_put_neon` / its C reference), the IDCT FFmpeg
actually uses for MPEG-4 at 8 bpp — the same transform this crate now
evaluates (see `src/ffmpeg_idct.rs`), which makes whole-stream
bit-exact comparison meaningful and matches `ffmpeg -f framemd5`:

```
ffmpeg -i <name>.m4v -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p <name>.yuv
```

(Historically the fixtures used `-idct faani`, the single-precision
floating-point IDCT; they were regenerated on 2026-10-05 when the
decoder switched to the integer transform.)

Two caveats measured against this oracle (see `tests/conformance.rs`
for the per-stream consequences):

* **Near-tie samples.** No longer expected: the oracle and the decoder
  now evaluate the same integer transform, so bit-exact streams compare
  exactly. Streams whose budgets predate the regeneration may still
  carry their old ±1 envelopes; those envelopes are upper bounds.
* **§7.4.4.5 mismatch control.** The oracle applies the method-1
  mismatch toggle to non-intra blocks only (verified by toggling our
  implementation per block class: intra-skip collapses the
  `mpeg_quant` stream's diffs from 3062 to 4). §7.4.4.5 has no intra
  exemption, so our decoder keeps the spec behaviour by default and
  the `mq_ipb_64x64` assertion carries a ±1 envelope; the opt-in
  ecosystem-compat mode (`DecodeOptions::ecosystem`) reproduces the
  oracle up to the 4 near-ties (`compat_*` pins in
  `tests/conformance.rs`).

## Streams (`.m4v`)

### Generated this round (commands recorded verbatim)

Source is the deterministic `lavfi` `testsrc2` generator; all encodes
are Simple/Advanced-Simple-profile MPEG-4 Part 2 at fixed `-qscale:v 4`.

### Field-qpel probe pins (`fq_probe_*.yuv`)

The seven `fq_probe_*.yuv` files are reference decodes of
**constructed** probe streams that arbitrated the §7.7.2.1
quarter-sample field-interpolation geometry (see
`tests/field_qpel_probes.rs`, which rebuilds each probe bitstream
deterministically — the streams themselves are therefore not stored).
Each probe is the `ilaced_qpel_ip_64x64.m4v` configuration headers +
I-VOP followed by one hand-written P-VOP: every macroblock skipped
except macroblock (1, 1), which is field-predicted
(`field_prediction == 1`) with chosen field reference selections and
field MVDs and no residual. Each expected output was produced by the
same black-box command as every other reference decode:

```
ffmpeg -idct faani -i fq_probe_<name>.m4v -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p fq_probe_<name>.yuv
```

These probes pinned two geometry facts the printed spec text leaves
open (both now the decoder's default reading, asserted bit-exact in
both behaviour modes): the 16-wide luma field block interpolates as
two 8×8 §7.6.2.2 blocks with per-sub-block Figure 7-30 mirroring, and
the chroma field MV's vertical quarter → half halving floors on the
field grid (`Div2Round(mv_y >> 2)`).

### Interlaced-direct probe pins (`dm_probe_*.yuv`)

The eight `dm_probe_*.yuv` files are reference decodes of constructed
probe streams that arbitrated the §7.7.2.2 interlaced-direct
derivation with **non-zero co-located field MVs over textured
anchors** (see `tests/direct_mode_probes.rs`, which rebuilds each
probe bitstream deterministically). Each probe is the
`ilaced_ipb_64x64.m4v` configuration headers + I-VOP, a hand-written
P-VOP whose macroblock (1, 1) is field-predicted with chosen field
reference selections and field MVs (all else skipped), and a
hand-written B-VOP whose macroblock (1, 1) is a direct macroblock
(zero-bit `modb "1"`, or explicit `modb "01"` + `mb_type "1"` with a
chosen `MVD[0]`). Expected outputs via the standard oracle command:

```
ffmpeg -idct faani -i dm_probe_<name>.m4v -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p dm_probe_<name>.yuv
```

Findings: the compat zero-co-located model is confirmed
unconditionally for non-zero and absent `MVD[0]`; a transmitted
`MVD[0] == (0, 0)` instead observes progressive direct over
`Div2Round(MVf1 + MVf2)` (documented divergence, ruling pending —
`tests/direct_mode_probes.rs` module docs).

### From earlier rounds

The remaining thirteen `.m4v` streams predate this notes file; they
were produced by the same black-box encoder from 64×64 `testsrc` /
`testsrc2` sources (Simple-Profile settings, GOP/`-bf`/tool flags as
described per-test in `tests/conformance.rs`), and
`ilaced_direct_176x144.m4v` is the interlaced direct-mode stream
staged in `docs/video/mpeg4-visual/fixtures/interlaced-direct-bframes/`
(refs #176). Their exact command lines were not recorded at the time;
their SHA-256 below pins the byte-exact inputs, and every `.yuv` was
regenerated this round with the command above.

## Encoder-produced streams (round 438)

The `enc_intra_*` pairs flow the OTHER way from every fixture above:
the `.m4v` streams were produced by **this crate's own encoder**
(`ivop_encode`, see `tests/encoder_blackbox.rs` — 3 I-VOPs, 64x64,
qp 4, cost-decided AC prediction, method-2 / method-1 quantisation)
from the deterministic synthetic source embedded in that test, and
the `.yuv` files are the black-box reference decodes of those
streams with the floating-point IDCT:

```
ffmpeg -idct faani -i enc_intra_m2_64x64.m4v -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p enc_intra_m2_64x64.yuv
ffmpeg -idct faani -i enc_intra_m1_64x64.m4v -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p enc_intra_m1_64x64.yuv
ffmpeg -idct faani -i enc_ip_m2_64x64.m4v -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p enc_ip_m2_64x64.yuv
```

`enc_ip_m2_64x64.m4v` is the I+P sibling (1 I-VOP + 5 P-VOPs over a
translating scene: §7.6 motion estimation, half-pel refinement,
`not_coded` skips; method-2, qp 4); its reference decode is
**bit-exact** against this crate's decode of the same stream.

The tests assert byte-determinism of re-encoding and bit-exact
agreement between this crate's decode of the streams and the
reference decode (the method-1 pair carries the documented §7.4.4.5
intra-mismatch divergence: ecosystem-compat mode is bit-exact, the
literal-spec decode differs on 834 samples by at most ±1). If the
encoder's output changes, regenerate BOTH files and re-measure.

## Encoder-produced streams (round 443)

The round-443 encoder tail added three more encoder-produced pairs
(each 1 I-VOP + 4 P-VOPs, 64x64, method-2, qp 4; sources embedded in
`tests/encoder_blackbox.rs`; regenerate the streams with
`OXIDEAV_MPEG4VIDEO_WRITE_FIXTURES=1 cargo test --test encoder_blackbox`):

* `enc_ip_4mv_64x64` — §6.3.7 inter4v (four-MV) macroblocks over a
  checkerboard of divergent 8x8-block motion fields;
* `enc_ip_qpel_64x64` — `quarter_sample == 1` (verid-2 VOL, ASP)
  over a smooth quarter-grid texture translating by (3, 1) quarter
  pels per frame (true fractional §7.6.2.2 motion);
* `enc_ip_qpel4mv_64x64` — both tools on the divergent-motion scene.
* `enc_ipb_64x64` — I/P/B via the registry encoder (`bf` 2: coded
  order I0 P3 B1 B2 + the flush tail; direct / forward / backward /
  interpolated §7.6.9 modes, `co_located_not_coded` zero-bit MBs,
  `vol_control_parameters` with `low_delay == 0`), 6 frames of the
  translating scene.
* `enc_ipb_qpel4mv_64x64` — the combined-tools sibling: `bf` 2 +
  `quarter_sample` + inter4v in one stream (direct mode over 4-MV
  co-located anchors on the quarter grid), 6 frames of the
  divergent-motion scene.

```
ffmpeg -idct faani -i enc_ip_4mv_64x64.m4v -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p enc_ip_4mv_64x64.yuv
ffmpeg -idct faani -i enc_ip_qpel_64x64.m4v -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p enc_ip_qpel_64x64.yuv
ffmpeg -idct faani -i enc_ip_qpel4mv_64x64.m4v -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p enc_ip_qpel4mv_64x64.yuv
ffmpeg -idct faani -i enc_ipb_64x64.m4v -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p enc_ipb_64x64.yuv
ffmpeg -idct faani -i enc_ipb_qpel4mv_64x64.m4v -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p enc_ipb_qpel4mv_64x64.yuv
```

All five reference decodes are **bit-exact** against this crate's
decode of the same streams (asserted in `tests/encoder_blackbox.rs`).

Round 452 added the `fcode > 1` pair (96×64, a textured background
translating by (20, 5) pels per frame — outside the `fcode == 1`
Table 7-9 range, so every P/B vector rides the `r_size`-bit residual
form of §6.2.6.2 `motion_vector()`):

* `enc_ip_fcode2_96x64` — `fcode` 2, half-sample I+P via the registry
  encoder (`gop-size` 12, qp 4), 6 frames;
* `enc_ipb_fcode3_qpel4mv_96x64` — `fcode` 3 + `quarter_sample` +
  inter4v + `bf` 2 (forward / backward / interpolated B vectors under
  the wide range; direct-mode deltas stay `fcode == 1`), 6 frames.

```
ffmpeg -idct faani -i enc_ip_fcode2_96x64.m4v -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p enc_ip_fcode2_96x64.yuv
ffmpeg -idct faani -i enc_ipb_fcode3_qpel4mv_96x64.m4v -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p enc_ipb_fcode3_qpel4mv_96x64.yuv
```

Both are bit-exact. (The `bf` 1 sibling of the second stream at qp 4
hit one near-tie sample — a single ±1 in one B-VOP, with the qp 3 /
5 / 6 and `bf` 2 variants all bit-exact — which is the documented
single-precision oracle caveat above, so the `bf` 2 variant was
pinned.)

The per-macroblock quantiser pair (96×48, four bands spanning every
activity class — flat / gradient / texture / full-range noise —
translating by (2, 1) pels per frame):

* `enc_ipb_aq4mv_96x48` — `mb-aq` (activity-classed `dquant` on
  I/P-VOPs as `intra+q` / `inter+q`, `dbquant` on B-VOPs) + inter4v
  (which carries no `dquant` and keeps the running quantiser) + `bf`
  2, qp 10, 6 frames.

```
ffmpeg -idct faani -i enc_ipb_aq4mv_96x48.m4v -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p enc_ipb_aq4mv_96x48.yuv
```

Bit-exact.

The error-resilience trio (registry encoder, 6 frames each):

* `enc_ipb_vp_fcode2_96x64` — §6.2.5 video packets (~500-bit
  target; `header_extension_code` alternating 1/0 so both header
  branches are decoded) in a combined-syntax I/P/B stream (`bf` 2,
  `fcode` 2 — the P marker is 17 zeros + 1, the B marker 17 zeros +
  1) over the 20-pel-per-frame scene;
* `enc_ip_dp_aq_96x48` — §6.2.5.3 data partitioning (`dc_marker` /
  `motion_marker`) + ~400-bit packets + per-macroblock `dquant`
  (`intra+q` in partition 1 of the I-VOP, `inter+q` / `intra+q` in
  partition 2 of the P-VOPs), I + 5 P over the mixed-activity scene;
* `enc_ipb_dprvlc_aq4mv_96x48` — data partitioning + reversible VLCs
  (Table B.23 texture partition incl. the Type-5 escape) + packets +
  `dquant` / `dbquant` + inter4v + `fcode` 2 + `bf` 2 (the B-VOPs stay
  combined-syntax inside the partitioned VOL, §6.2.5.3 NOTE).

```
ffmpeg -idct faani -i enc_ipb_vp_fcode2_96x64.m4v -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p enc_ipb_vp_fcode2_96x64.yuv
ffmpeg -idct faani -i enc_ip_dp_aq_96x48.m4v -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p enc_ip_dp_aq_96x48.yuv
ffmpeg -idct faani -i enc_ipb_dprvlc_aq4mv_96x48.m4v -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p enc_ipb_dprvlc_aq4mv_96x48.yuv
```

All three bit-exact.

The GMC pair (96×64, a background panning by (6, 2) pels per frame):

* `enc_isb_gmc_qpel_96x64` — S(GMC)-VOP anchors (one §7.8.4 warping
  point, half-pel accuracy, per-MB `mcsel`) + quarter-sample + `bf` 2
  + `fcode` 3 + ~600-bit video packets (S packets carry no HEC), 6
  frames.

```
ffmpeg -idct faani -i enc_isb_gmc_qpel_96x64.m4v -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p enc_isb_gmc_qpel_96x64.yuv
```

Bit-exact (stream regenerated twice in round 455: after the
GMC-vs-local preference became quantiser-scaled, and again once the
S(GMC)-VOP video packets started carrying `header_extension_code`
bodies with the `sprite_trajectory()` restatement — the reference
decode is byte-identical across both, and the reference decoder's
`untested` remark on those HEC bodies is its own path-coverage note).
Two findings from this pair's validation:

* **Table B.34 `dmv_length`** — the crate's `warping_mv_code()`
  reader (and the first encoder cut) treated `dmv_length` as a plain
  unary run; Table B.34 actually assigns `00`→0, `010`..`110`→1..=5
  and `SSS−3` one-bits + `0` for 6..=14. Fixed on both sides; crafted
  pure-GMC-copy probes (integer-pel, half-pel, negative, ±16-pel,
  vertical trajectories) then decoded **bit-exact** through the
  reference binary.
* **§7.8.7.3 non-positive averaged-MV divergence** — the reference
  decoder derives each *non-positive* AMV component one MV-grid unit
  lower than the §7.8.7.3 quantisation (probed with crafted
  GMC-neighbour + zero-MVD-local streams: half-sample du −2→−3,
  −3→−4, −4→−5, −10→−11, 0→−1; quarter-sample −6→−7, −8→−9, −18→−19,
  −20→−21; strictly positive components exact; per-component
  independent). The AMV feeds the §7.6.5 predictor candidates of
  local macroblocks and the §7.6.9 frame-direct co-located
  substitution. The decoder keeps the spec-literal quantisation by
  default; the opt-in **ecosystem-compat** mode now covers the rule
  (compat divergence 3), pinned by the `dec_sgmc_*` pairs below. The
  encoder fixture pans so every trajectory component stays strictly
  positive.

The compat-divergence-3 pins (`tests/compat_gmc_amv.rs`; the `.m4v`
sides are deterministic builds of that file, the `.yuv` sides the
reference decodes):

* `dec_sgmc_negamv_hp_64x64` — crafted half-pel probe (trajectory
  (−3, −7); GMC-coded MB, zero-MVD local MB, `not_coded` GMC copies);
* `dec_sgmc_negamv_qp_64x64` — the quarter-sample sibling
  (trajectory (−4, −10));
* `dec_sgmc_negtraj_96x64` — a full encoder-produced 4-frame S(GMC)
  stream whose dominant-motion trajectories go negative and zero
  (fcode 1 against 20-pel-per-frame motion). Ecosystem-compat decode
  is **bit-exact** against all three reference decodes; the
  spec-literal decode differs exactly where the rule bites. (Pair
  regenerated in round 455 after the GMC-vs-local preference became
  quantiser-scaled — same construction, new decisions, same result.)

```
ffmpeg -idct faani -i dec_sgmc_negamv_hp_64x64.m4v -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p dec_sgmc_negamv_hp_64x64.yuv

ffmpeg -idct faani -i dec_sgmc_negtraj_96x64.m4v -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p dec_sgmc_negtraj_96x64.yuv
```

## Encoder-produced streams (round 455 — interlaced tools)

Deterministic builds of `tests/encoder_interlaced.rs` (the `.m4v`
sides; `OXIDEAV_MPEG4VIDEO_WRITE_FIXTURES=1` regenerates them) over a
synthetic scene whose two fields translate independently, with the
reference decodes produced as above:

* `enc_ilaced_ip_64x64` — interlaced VOL, I + 3 P: per-macroblock
  §7.7.1 field DCT (`dct_type`), §7.7.2.1 field-predicted macroblocks
  (both reference-field parities, CASE 1/2/3 predictors), half-sample,
  fcode 1, qp 4. **Bit-exact.**
* `enc_ilaced_ipbb_compat_96x64` — interlaced I P B B P B B (coding
  order I0 P3 B1 B2 P6 B4 B5) with the ecosystem-compat emission (no
  direct mode over a field-predicted co-located macroblock): field
  forward / backward / bidirectional B macroblocks through the Table
  7-14 four-PMV bank, frame B modes, progressive direct, field DCT on
  B residuals. **Bit-exact.**
* `enc_ilaced_ipbb_spec_qpel_96x64` — the spec-literal emission with
  quarter-sample motion: §7.7.2.2 interlaced-direct macroblocks over
  field-predicted anchors. Anchors bit-exact; every differing sample
  lies inside an interlaced-direct macroblock, and the crate's
  ecosystem-compat decode (`DecodeOptions::ecosystem`) of this stream
  reproduces the reference decode **bit-exactly** — compat divergence
  1 confirmed on encoder-produced content.

```
ffmpeg -idct faani -i enc_ilaced_ip_64x64.m4v -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p enc_ilaced_ip_64x64.yuv
ffmpeg -idct faani -i enc_ilaced_ipbb_compat_96x64.m4v -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p enc_ilaced_ipbb_compat_96x64.yuv
ffmpeg -idct faani -i enc_ilaced_ipbb_spec_qpel_96x64.m4v -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p enc_ilaced_ipbb_spec_qpel_96x64.yuv
```

Two decoder findings from this validation (both black-box-arbitrated
on these pairs, conformance corpus unchanged):

* **§7.6.3 wrap on field vectors** — the reference decoder applies the
  §7.6.3 `[low:high]` modulo wrap to a §7.7.2.1 field vector on its
  own grid (horizontal in frame units, vertical in *field* units before
  the doubling); the crate's P-VOP field reconstruction now does the
  same (`reconstruct_field_motion_vectors_wrapped`), and the encoder
  keeps every field component inside the range so the wrap never
  fires on its own streams.
* **§7.6.4 clamp of a quarter-sample field read** — a field block whose
  vector reaches past the bottom edge clamps to the VOP's edge line on
  the *frame* grid (whatever its parity), as the half-sample field
  `mc` routine already did; the quarter-sample field view previously
  clamped within the field.

## Interlaced S(GMC) stream (round 455)

* `enc_isb_ilaced_gmc_compat_96x64` — registry build (`interlaced`,
  `gmc`, `fcode 2`, `bf 2`, `ecosystem-compat`, qp 5; deterministic
  from `tests/encoder_interlaced.rs`) over a split scene: the left half
  pans coherently (GMC macroblocks, frame-predicted per §7.8.7.2, field
  DCT on their residuals), the right half has independent field
  velocities (§7.7.2.1 field-predicted `mcsel == 0` macroblocks against
  the GMC neighbours' averaged-MV candidates); interlaced B-VOPs over
  the S anchors' field motion (compat emission — no interlaced direct).
  The reference decode is **bit-exact**, log clean — the reference
  decoder also reads `dct_type` on a coded `mcsel == 1` macroblock, the
  §6.3.6.3 reading this crate's parser now follows.

```
ffmpeg -idct faani -i enc_isb_ilaced_gmc_compat_96x64.m4v -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p enc_isb_ilaced_gmc_compat_96x64.yuv
```

## Multi-point GMC streams (round 455 — §7.8.4 two / three warping points)

Deterministic builds of `tests/encoder_gmc_affine.rs` over a
bilinearly-resampled synthetic scene (fixed-point, byte-deterministic),
reference decodes as above (`ffmpeg -idct faani -i <name>.m4v …`):

* `enc_is_gmc3_zoom_96x64` — I + 3 S(GMC) with
  `no_of_sprite_warping_points == 3`: a 1/64-per-frame zoom about the
  origin plus a (2, 1)-pel pan, fitted (mode-seeded robust least
  squares + coordinate-descent refinement on the decoder's own warp)
  into the affine trajectory `[[4, 2], [3, 0], [0, 2]]`; every
  trajectory component and every §7.8.7.3 averaged MV is
  non-negative. **Bit-exact** — the first black-box confirmation of the
  §7.8.4 virtual-sprite-point / §7.8.5 three-point affine arithmetic
  on both sides.
* `enc_is_gmc2_rot_96x64` — I + 3 S(GMC) with two warping points: a
  1/32-rad rotation plus a (1, 0)-pel pan → `[[2, 0], [0, 6]]`. The
  S pictures are bit-exact (the §7.8.5 similarity warp included, with
  averaged MVs of both signs feeding the §7.6.5 predictors of the local
  macroblocks); the I picture carries **one** near-tie IDCT sample,
  which the first S picture copies through its GMC prediction — 2 of
  36864 samples, ±1.

## AC-VLC intra DC + S(GMC) packet HEC (round 455)

* `enc_isb_dcvlc7_hec_96x64` — registry build (`gmc`, `fcode 2`, `bf 1`,
  `dc-vlc-thr 7`, `mb-aq`, `packet-bits 500`, qp 6; deterministic from
  `tests/encoder_dc_vlc_hec.rs`): every intra DC differential rides the
  AC VLC (`intra_dc_vlc_thr == 7`, Table 6-25), the S(GMC)-VOP video
  packets alternate `header_extension_code` bodies that restate
  `sprite_trajectory()` (§6.2.5), B-VOPs between the S anchors. The
  reference decode is **bit-exact**. Black-box observation: the
  reference decoder logs an `untested` notice while consuming the
  S-VOP packet HEC bodies (its own path-coverage remark — the pair
  without S-VOP HEC bodies decodes silently), yet reconstructs every
  sample identically.

```
ffmpeg -idct faani -i enc_isb_dcvlc7_hec_96x64.m4v -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p enc_isb_dcvlc7_hec_96x64.yuv
```

## Short-header streams (round 455 — §6.2.5.2 `short_video_header == 1`)

Raw H.263-compatible elementary streams (`.h263`: byte-aligned
`short_video_start_marker` pictures, no VOS/VOL), decoded with the
reference binary's raw short-header demuxer selected:

```
ffmpeg -idct faani -f h263 -i <name>.h263 -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p <name>.yuv
```

* `enc_sh_ippip_176x144` — deterministic build of
  `tests/encoder_short_header.rs` (`OXIDEAV_MPEG4VIDEO_WRITE_FIXTURES=1`
  regenerates it): QCIF I P P I P, GOB headers on every GOB after the
  first, adaptive `dquant`, 8-bit `intra_dc_coefficient` FLC, Table
  B.17 + Type-4 escapes, picture-restricted half-sample vectors, end
  marker. The reference decode is **bit-exact** against our closed
  loop.
* `sh_ipp_176x144` — reference-encoder-produced QCIF I P P I P
  (`-c:v h263 -qscale:v 4 -g 3`, the H.263 baseline the short header
  encapsulates):

```
ffmpeg -f lavfi -i "testsrc2=size=176x144:rate=25:duration=0.2" \
  -c:v h263 -qscale:v 4 -g 3 -f h263 sh_ipp_176x144.h263
```

  Our short-header decode is **bit-exact** against the reference
  decode (no near-tie samples on this stream).

## Budget-driven rate control (round 458)

Registry builds from `tests/encoder_rate_blackbox.rs` (96×64, 25 fps,
`bitrate 300000`, `gop-size 12`, `bf 2`, `mb-aq`, `four-mv`, seed qp
6; a panning texture whose second half gains a second texture layer):
every I/P macroblock's `dquant` and every coded non-direct B
macroblock's `dbquant` is driven by the GOP budget through the
per-macroblock regulator, so the running quantiser moves in both
directions inside every VOP.

* `enc_ipb_rcbudget_96x64` — one-pass budget mode: 301 692 b/s
  (×1.006 of the target), luma PSNR 33.49 dB. **Bit-exact** reference
  decode.
* `enc_ipb_rc2pass_96x64` — two-pass (the first run's per-VOP
  statistics fed back through `with_first_pass_stats`): 299 875 b/s
  (×1.000), luma PSNR 33.62 dB. **Bit-exact** reference decode.

* `enc_ilaced_rcbudget_compat_96x64` — the same budget mode on an
  interlaced VOL (`interlaced`, `ecosystem-compat`, `qpel`): budget-
  driven `dquant` on field-DCT / field-predicted anchors, `dbquant` on
  interlaced B macroblocks; 303 492 b/s (×1.012), luma PSNR 33.17 dB.
  **Bit-exact** reference decode.

```
ffmpeg -idct faani -i enc_ipb_rcbudget_96x64.m4v -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p enc_ipb_rcbudget_96x64.yuv
ffmpeg -idct faani -i enc_ipb_rc2pass_96x64.m4v -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p enc_ipb_rc2pass_96x64.yuv
ffmpeg -idct faani -i enc_ilaced_rcbudget_compat_96x64.m4v -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p enc_ilaced_rcbudget_compat_96x64.yuv
```

## S(GMC) + data partitioning (round 458 — black-box observation, no pair)

`tests/encoder_gmc_dp.rs` builds S(GMC)-VOPs on the §6.2.5.3
`data_partitioned_p_vop()` layout (partition 1: `not_coded`, `mcbpc`,
`mcsel` on `derived_mb_type < 2`, `motion_coding()` only when
`mcsel == 0`). The reference decoder does **not** follow those
clauses: on a data-partitioned S-VOP it desynchronises at the very
first macroblock (measured per macroblock: every macroblock of the
first S picture differs, intra ones included, while the leading I-VOP
is bit-exact and the same encoder's combined-syntax S(GMC) streams —
`enc_isb_*` — stay bit-exact; packets, RVLC, warping-point count and
B-VOPs change nothing). No reference decode is therefore committed
for the combination; the crate keeps the printed syntax on both sides
and validates it through its own decoder walk.
